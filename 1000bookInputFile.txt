Blurb: For over twenty years Reina has sexually celebrated the women around her with a reverence only tolerated by her wife, Aiko. But when Reina misinterprets the fluidity of their open relationship, she's backed into a corner where her gender dysphoria reigns supreme. In order to salvage her marriage, she may have to reanalyze the way she views the world, her life, and her experiences.,Just when she thinks she's figured her spouse out, Aiko faces an unexpected transgression. Can she forgive her? Or will love finally give way to the fatigue that accompanies being with someone like Reina? A sick mother and unsympathetic sister are not helping Aiko's dilemma.,Even the most passionate relationships sometimes fall asunder to "seikou," the sexual character at the core of one's identity. Will Reina and Aiko reunite with stronger hearts, or is it finally time to go their separate ways? And if they do split up, who will help them pick up the pieces - the stoic therapist, the desperate socialite, or the young couple who initiated this mess to begin with?

Blurb: Altri libertini ha avuto fin dagli inizi una vita avventurosa: pubblicato nel 1980, sequestrato per oscenit e poi assolto dal tribunale ('con formula ampia'),  stato contemporaneamente giudicato dalla critica una delle opere migliori degli ultimi anni e ha imposto Tondelli tra i nuovi autori italiani pi letti anche all'estero.,I sei episodi, storie di gruppi pi che di individui, legittimano l'adozione di una vera e propria soggettivit plurale, di un Noi narrativo che fa del romanzo un ritratto generazionale: sullo sfondo della fauna scatenata che si muove nelle pagine di Tondelli c' l'irrequietezza dell'ambiente studentesco bolognese, che al "realismo" della borghesia e alla rassegnazione del sottoproletariato oppone un vitalismo non eroico, ma disinibito e contagioso. Sia la disinvoltura con la quale Altri libertini, aggressiva opera prima, affronta vecchi tab sia l'ironica diffidenza con la quale tratta mitologie culturali e politiche testimoniano dell'intima appartenenza dell'autore a una letteratura nuova e combattiva.

Blurb: Chris Tilling makes a fresh contribution to the debate about whether or not Pauls Christology is divine. To this end he analyses the Pauline data that details the relation between the risen Lord and Christians. With reference to contemporary debates regarding Jewish monotheism, he argues that the Pauline Christ-relation corresponds - as a pattern - solely to language concerning YHWHs relation to Israel in Second Temple Judaism. This is the case, Tilling maintains, even in texts such as Sirach 44-50, the "Life of Adam and Eve" and the Similitudes of Enoch. In dialogue both with concerns that one cannot properly speak of a Pauline Christology, and recent studies in Pauls epistemology, Chris Tilling presents Pauls Christology as fully divine, but in a particular way: the Christ-relation is Pauls divine-Christology expressed as relationship. In light of this, he not only reengages arguments deployed by those disputing a Pauline divine-Christology, but also draws additional conclusions relating to the interface between biblical and systematic theological concerns.

Blurb: From classical temples to twentieth century towers, engineers have learned more about design from failure than from success. The concept of error, according to the author of Design Paradigms, is central to the design process. As a way of explaining the enduring aspects of engineering design, Henry Petroski relates stories of some of the greatest engineering successes and failures of all time. These case studies, drawn from a wide range of times and places, from Ancient Greece and Rome to modern America, serve as paradigms of error and judgment in engineering design. By showing how errors were introduced in the design process and how they might be avoided, the book suggests how better quality and reliability might be achieved in designed devices, structures, and systems of all kinds. Clearly written, with striking illustrations, the book will appeal to engineering students, practicing engineers, historians of science and technology, and all those interested in learning about the process of design.

Blurb: Evangelists of human progress meet their opposite in Matthew White's epic examination of history's one hundred most violent events, or, in White's piquant phrasing, "the numbers that people want to argue about." Reaching back to 480 BCE's second Persian War, White moves chronologically through history to this century's war in the Congo and devotes chapters to each event, where he surrounds hard facts (time and place) and succinct takeaways (who usually gets the blame?) with lively military, social, and political histories. With the eye of a seasoned statistician, White assigns each entry a ranking based on body count, and in doing so he gives voice to the suffering of ordinary people that, inexorably, has defined every historical epoch. By turns droll, insightful, matter-of-fact, and ultimately sympathetic to those who died, ,The Great Big Book of Horrible Things, gives readers a chance to reach their own conclusions while offering a stark reminder of the darkness of the human heart.

Blurb: A long time ago, fire belonged only to the animals in the land above, not to those on the earth below. Curlew, keeper of the sky world, guarded fire and kept it from the earth. Coyote, however, devised a clever plan to steal fire, aided by Grizzly Bear, Wren, Snake, Frog, Eagle, and Beaver. These brave and resourceful animal beings raided the land above and risked all to steal fire from Curlew.,Beaver Steals Fire, is an ancient and powerful tale springing from the hearts and experiences of the Salish people of Montana. Steeped in the rich and culturally vital storytelling tradition of the tribe, this tale teaches both respect for fire and awareness of its significance, themes particularly relevant today. This unforgettable version of the story is told by Salish elder Johnny Arlee and beautifully illustrated by tribal artist Sam Sandoval.

Blurb: The emphasis of ,Planetary Atmospheres, is on comparative aspects of planetary atmospheres, generally meaning comparison with the Earth, including atmospheric composition, thermal structure, cloud properties, dynamics, weather and climate, and aeronomy. The goal is to look for common processes at work under different boundary conditions in order to reach a fundamental understanding of the physics of atmospheres. As part of a general Physics course, the material is chosen to emphasise certain aspects that will be of broad topical interest:,- evolutionary processes, setting the Earth in its context as a planet and a member of the Solar System,- the properties of atmospheres that affect the climate near the surface of each planet,- measurement techniques and models, where the same experimental and theoretical physics is applied under different conditions to investigate and explain atmospheric behaviour.,These might be thought of as the astronomical, environmental, and technical sides of the discipline respectively.,The book covers the basic physics of planetary atmospheres in a single text for students or anyone interested in this area of science. The approach is the same as in the author's previous book ,Elementary Climate Physics: ,an overview, followed by more detailed discussion of key topics arranged by physical phenomenon and not planet by planet as usually found in this field. There is an emphasis on acquiring and interpreting measurements, and the basic physics of instruments and models, with key definitions and some historical background in footnotes and in the glossary at the end of the book.

Blurb: "Competitive Advantage Through People" explores why - despite long-standing evidence that a committed work force is essential for success - firms continue to attach little importance to their workers. The answer, argues Pfeffer, resides in a complex web of factors based on perception, history, legislation, and practice that continues to dominate management thought and action. Yet, some organizations have been able to overcome these obstacles. In fact, the five common stocks with the highest returns between 1972 and 1992 - Southwest Airlines, Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, Circuit City, and Plenum Publishing - were in industries that shared virtually none of the characteristics traditionally associated with strategic success. What each of these firms did share is the ability to produce sustainable competitive advantage through its way of managing people. Pfeffer documents how they - and others - resisted traditional management pitfalls, and offers frameworks for implementing these changes in any industry.

Is Thanksgiving really a holiday for Jews?Rivka's grandmother, Bubbeh, decides to take over: She will bring Rivka to see the Rabbi Yoshe Preminger -- and whatever the Rabbi concludes, Rivka will have to live with. Rivka knows that Thanksgiving is a holiday for all Americans, from all backgrounds and religions. But how can she convince the esteemed Rabbi Preminger?,Elsa Okon Rael and Maryann Kovalski bring the bustling Lower East Side to life in this heartwarming story. Set in the 1910s, "Rivka's First Thanksgiving" is about respecting old traditions while embracing new ones, about giving thanks and celebrating freedom in America. Perhaps most important, Rivka's story teaches us that even the wisest adults have something to learn from children.

Blurb: Over eleven thousand years ago the plains of the great Southwest were covered with sweet long-season grass and inhabited by camels, bison, mammoths, dire wolves, and the hunter gatherers we now call the Clovis people. This story of Willow, Jak, Etol, and their clan takes place in a land that we unconsciously recognize, and shows us people whose needs, hopes, and fears are our own. They live in a world where communication with animals, plants, and even stones is not only possible but essential for survival. Willow's life path echoes that of Half Ear and Red Fur, the matriarchs of the woolly mammoth herd. By joining their stories, Russell explores an archaeological puzzle: the extinction of nearly eighty percent of large land mammals at the end of the Pleistocene. The meaning of being human lies at the heart of the puzzle. Russell's imaginative reconstruction of the world of Willow and her clan illumines the tribal self--the basket maker, the mammoth hunter, the healer, the shaman--that still lives in each of us.,"Books like this one can teach us not only the facts of the Paleolithic past, but also allow us to share the experiences of our ancestors. "The Last Matriarch" does both and does them beautifully."--Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, author of "Reindeer Moon"

Blurb: Once upon a time the Himmlers were just a normal German family, middle-class, hard-working, well-educated. There were three brothers, Gebhart, Heinrich, and Ernst. Heinrich grew up to become the head of Hitlers SS, mastermind of the concentration camp system, and chief perpetrator of the Holocaust. When Katrin Himmler, Heinrichs great-niece, was 15, one of her schoolmates asked during a history lesson if she was related to the Himmler. "Yes," she stammered, at which there was a deathly hush in the classroom and the teacher, embarrassed and unsure, quickly moved the lesson on. As she grew older, Katrin gave her family history a wide berth, but married to an Israeli whose family was confined to the Warsaw Ghetto and with a young, half-Jewish son, she realizes that she cannot evade the past so easily. Katrin Himmlers cool but meticulous examination of the Himmler story revealsin all its dark complexitythe gulf between the "normality" of bourgeois family life and the horrors perpetrated by one member and a more nuanced portrait of Heinrich himself emergesnot a lone evil executioner, but a middle-class family man, loved and fully supported by his respectable German family.

Blurb: Het best bewaarde literaire geheim van Nederland,' vindt Esther Verhoef van Alex Boogers. 'Al zijn romans zijn potentile bestsellers.' Zijn nieuwe roman, Alle dingen zijn schitterend, gaat over drie vaders wier levens elkaar op een cruciaal moment kruisen. Remy van Sand raakt de grip op zijn leven kwijt als hij slecht nieuws krijgt van zijn arts. Hij stopt met lesgeven en schrijft manisch in zijn dagboeken. Hierdoor wordt zijn grootste angst werkelijkheid: hij komt steeds verder van zijn vrouw en negenjarige dochter af te staan.,De tweede jonge vader, Arthur Rauwman, is een journalist die wacht op een donorhart voor zijn zoontje Taij. In het ziekenhuis komt Taij op een bijzondere manier in contact met Remy. Rechercheur Roeland Markus, vader van puberdochter Zo, maakt de driehoek compleet.,Alle dingen zijn schitterend is een rijke roman met veel tegenslag, maar achter de ellende schittert steeds de hoop. Bobby Fischers uitspraak 'Nothing is so healing as the human touch,' is het rake motto van deze even gevoelige als spannende roman.

Blurb: Some of horse racing's most respected authorities looked at feats of greatness, world records, legendary rivalries, and innovations to rank the sport's top 100 moments. They weighed individual accomplishments against industry initiatives, innovations against lucky breaks to come up with the definitive list. They pondered Secretariat's 31-length Belmont Stakes victory, Smarty Jones' elusive Triple Crown, the creation of the Breeders' Cup, and advancements in equine surgery. Racing's top 100 list will generate debate for years to come, just as did the ranking of Man o' War over Secretariat as Horse of the Century. Richly illustrated with historic and modern photos, Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments also contains comprehensive lists of leading earners, fastest times, highest prices, and most races won.

Blurb: The American attack on Quebec in 1775 was a key episode in the American War of Independence (1775-1783). Capture of the city would give the Americans control of Canada  a disaster for the British. The subsequent campaign involved a 350-mile trek across uninhabited wilderness, a desperate American attack on the city of Quebec that left one American general dead and another wounded, and a British counterattack that culminated in a brutal naval battle off Valcour Island on Lake Champlain. In this book Brendan Morrissey details the events of this ferocious struggle whose results would have such momentous consequences at Saratoga in 1777.

Excerpt: ... HARVARD UNIVERSITY LIBRARY V _ Copyrighted by Charles A. Lindbergh 1917 NATIONAL CAPITAL PRESS, INC., WASHINGTON, D To Readers: Materially connected with the conditions as they exist now, is my book bearing the title, "Banking and Currency and The Money Trust," published 1913, in which is the following prefatory statement: The market prices of commodities vary from day to day and often'several times a day. This occurs when there is no radical difference in the pro-portion of supply and the natural demands. This fact is conclusive proof that our system is controlled by manipulators and is fundamentally wrong. I have sought to elucidate this problem within this volume and have suggested a plan which, if adopted, would make the people themselves master of the world, instead of the present master--The Money Trust. What I predicted in the book above referred to is now taking place. The "press" controlled by "big business" at the time of the publication of that book, attacked me savagely for predicting dire results from the "big business" system. We now have what I then said we would have. I make no claim to magic knowledge. On the contrary, any attempt to say what the future will bring, I maintain would be a folly unless it is based upon facts that inevitably lead to certain things. There are facts that do that, and it is upon such facts that I published that book, and now again publish this new book, widening the scope of consideration by taking additional subjects. The former book is cloth bound, has 318 pages, and will be sent to an address postage prepaid for $1.00. Its contents are as important now as when written, and immensely more interesting because of the subsequent developments. Charles A. Lindbergh, P. O. Address, either ...

Blurb: Domesticating Information: Managing Documents Inside the Organization examines records and documents as complex business objects and explores the many different perspectives required for their management. Viewing documents as business objects requires a much different perspective from treating them as cultural artifacts, where preservation is the primary concern. When viewed as business objects, documents must be looked at in terms of integration with business processes, in defense of litigation subpoenas, or in the implementation of information technology. As a consequence, records managers are business analysts, and therefore are treated as such in this book. How information technology, the law, archives, and library & information science scholarship address and affect document and records management are all considered. Topics covered include: how to manage documents and records in any environment, hard copy vs. electronic documents, and how to create a foundation for managing records that addresses the needs of business and government. By addressing the needs of business and government, the needs of citizens, business web stakeholders, and archivists are also fully addressed.

Blurb: Germans of the generation born just before the outbreak of World War I lived through a tumultuous and dramatic century. This book tells the story of their lives and, in so doing, offers a new history of twentieth-century Germany, as experienced and made by ordinary human beings.,On the basis of sixty-two oral-history interviews, this book shows how this generation was shaped psychologically by a series of historically engendered losses over the course of the century. In response, this generation turned to the collective to repair the losses it had suffered, most fatefully to the community of the Volk during the Third Reich, a racial collective to which this generation was passionately committed and which was at the heart of National Socialism and its popular appeal.

A cryptic encounter in the perfumed darkness of Bali; a tour of a Bolivian prison, conducted by an enterprising inmate; a nightmarish taxi ride across southern Yemen, where the men with guns may be customs inspectors or revolutionariesthese are just three of the stops on Pico Iyers latest itinerary. ,But the true subject of ,Sun After Dark, is the dislocations of the mind in transit. And so Iyer takes us along to meditate with Leonard Cohen and talk geopolitics with the Dalai Lama. He navigates the Magritte-like landscape of jet lag, a place that no human had ever been until forty or so years ago. And on every page of this poetic and provocative book, he compels us to redraw our map of the world.

Blurb: Often regarded as the last great composer in the Austro-Germanic tradition, Gustave Mahler (18601911) exerted a major influence on 20th-century music; his later work in particular affected the musical ideas of such composers as Arnold Schoenberg, Dimitri Shostakovich, Alban Berg, and Benjamin Britten.,While his mature work foreshadowed radical elements of modern music  particularly the dissolution of tonality  Mahler's first symphonies were written in a relatively traditional programmatic style with a strong spiritual element. These early works are seen by some critics as attempting to "establish some ultimate ground for existence in the face of pain, death, doubt, and despair." The composer's spiritual quest, as well as the vivid orchestration, innovative symphonic structure, and rich emotional expression that characterized his music can be clearly studied and appreciated in this volume, which contains complete scores of Mahler's first two symphonies.,Of the ,Symphony No. 1 in D Major, ("Titan"), the ,Encyclopaedia Britannica, notes, "The program of the purely orchestral ,Symphony No. 1 in D Major , is autobiographical of his youth; the joy of life becomes clouded over by an obsession with death in the macabre "Funeral March in the Manner of Callot (basically a parody of popular music), which is eventually routed in the arduous and brilliant finale.",Of ,Symphony No. 1 in C Minor,, ("Resurrection"), ,Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, states: "Symphony II is a good example of all Mahler's works  scored nearly always heavily for a large orchestra, restless and stormy in places, monumentally exalted in others.",Now both works are available in this handsome, inexpensive edition, reproduced directly from the original editions published by Josef Weinberger in Vienna in 1897 and 1899. Beautifully printed with wide margins and clear noteheads, this edition of the symphonies offers an unparalleled resource for studying and enjoying the seminal works of a modern master.

Blurb: One of our foremost thinkers and public intellectuals offers a radical new view of the nature of time and the cosmos.,The fact that time is real may seem obvious. You experience it passing every day when you watch clocks tick, bread toast, and children grow. But most physicists see things differently, from Newton to Einstein to todays quantum theorists. For them, time isnt real. You may think you experience time passing, but they say its just an illusion.,Lee Smolin, author of the controversial bestseller ,The Trouble with Physics,, argues this limited notion of time is holding physics back. Its time for a major revolution in scientific thought. The reality of time could be the key to the next big breakthrough in theoretical physics.,What if the laws of physics themselves were not timeless? What if they could evolve? ,Time Reborn, offers a radical new approach to cosmology that embraces the reality of time and opens up a whole new universe of possibilties. There are few ideas that, like our notion of time, shape our thinking about literally everything, with major implications for physics and beyondfrom climate change to the economic crisis. Smolin explains in lively and lucid prose how the true nature of time impacts our world.

Blurb: Interviews are a frequent and important part of empirical research in political science, but graduate programs rarely offer discipline-specific training in selecting interviewees, conducting interviews, and using the data thus collected. ,Interview Research in Political Science, addresses this vital need, offering hard-won advice for both graduate students and faculty members. The contributors to this book have worked in a variety of field locations and settings and have interviewed a wide array of informants, from government officials to members of rebel movements and victims of wartime violence, from lobbyists and corporate executives to workers and trade unionists.,The authors encourage scholars from all subfields of political science to use interviews in their research, and they provide a set of lessons and tools for doing so. The book addresses how to construct a sample of interviewees; how to collect and report interview data; and how to address ethical considerations and the Institutional Review Board process. Other chapters discuss how to link interview-based evidence with causal claims; how to use proxy interviews or an interpreter to improve access; and how to structure interview questions. A useful appendix contains examples of consent documents, semistructured interview prompts, and interview protocols.

Blurb: In this exquisite lullaby, the beauty and wonder of a northern winter night unfold, with images of a soft snowfall, the wild animals that appear in the garden, the twinkling stars, the gentle rhythm of the northern lights and the etchings of frost on the window pane.,As the young child sleeps, wrapped in a downy blanket, a snowflake falls, and then another and another. The poem describes the forest of snow-covered pines, where a deer and fawn nibble a frozen apple, and a great gray owl swoops down with its feathers trailing through the snow. Two snowshoe hares scamper and play under the watchful eyes of a little fox, and a tiny mouse scurries in search of a midnight feast. When the snow clouds disappear, stars light up the sky, followed by the mystical shimmering of northern lights - all framed by the frost on the window.,Jean E. Pendziwol's lyrical poem reflects a deep appreciation of the magic of a northern winter night where, even as a child slumbers, the world outside does not rest but continues its own natural rhythms.,Isabelle Arsenault's spare, beautifully rendered illustrations, with their subtle but striking use of color, make us feel that we too are experiencing the enchantment of that northern night. They simultaneously evoke winter's nighttime life and the cozy warmth and security of a beloved child's sleep.

Blurb: Sophisticated, witty, and ingeniously convincing, Susanna Clarke's magisterial novel weaves magic into a flawlessly detailed vision of historical England. She has created a world so thoroughly enchanting that eight hundred pages leave readers longing for more.,English magicians were once the wonder of the known world, with fairy servants at their beck and call; they could command winds, mountains, and woods. But by the early 1800s they have long since lost the ability to perform magic. They can only write long, dull papers about it, while fairy servants are nothing but a fading memory.,But at Hurtfew Abbey in Yorkshire, the rich, reclusive Mr Norrell has assembled a wonderful library of lost and forgotten books from England's magical past and regained some of the powers of England's magicians. He goes to London and raises a beautiful young woman from the dead. Soon he is lending his help to the government in the war against Napoleon Bonaparte, creating ghostly fleets of rain-ships to confuse and alarm the French.,All goes well until a rival magician appears. Jonathan Strange is handsome, charming, and talkative-the very opposite of Mr Norrell. Strange thinks nothing of enduring the rigors of campaigning with Wellington's army and doing magic on battlefields. Astonished to find another practicing magician, Mr Norrell accepts Strange as a pupil. But it soon becomes clear that their ideas of what English magic ought to be are very different. For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear.

Blurb: The coauthor of the classic bestseller Boundaries, with over 2 million copies sold, and an expert on the psychology of business and leadership performance explains the behavioral reasons why some people get great results and others don't.,In Boundaries for Leaders, Dr. Henry Cloud gives leaders the tools and techniques they need to achieve the performance they desirein their organizations and in themselves. Drawing on the latest findings from neuroscience, Dr. Cloud shows why it's critical for leaders to set the conditions that make people's brains perform at their highest levels. How do great leaders do this? One way is through the creation of "boundaries"structures that determine what will exist and what will not.,Here you will learn seven leadership boundaries that set the stage, tone, and culture for a results-driven organization, including how to:, help people focus their attention on the things that matter most;, build the emotional climate that drives brain functioning;, facilitate connections that boost energy and momentum;, create organizational thought patterns that limit negativity and helplessness;, identify paths for people to take control of the activities that drive results;, create high-performance teams organized around the behaviors that drive results; and, lead yourself in a manner that protects the vision.,The strong call to action in this book is that leaders are ridiculously in charge of all these elements, and they must own what they either create or allow to exist.,Filled with inspiring and practical examples from Dr. Cloud's coaching practice, Boundaries for Leaders is essential reading for everyone who aspires to lead companies, teams, and cultures defined by high performance and healthy relationships.

Infamous for his lecherous tendencies, his midnight trysts with a coven of witches and his boundless self-interest, he was a man of few friends. So when Hugh Corbett is asked to bring his murderer to justice it is not a matter of finding a suspect but of choosing between them. ,Immediate suspicion falls on Lord Henry's chief verderer, Robert Verlian. His daughter had been the focus of Lord Henry's roving eye in the weeks before his death and he was not a man to take no for an answer. But the culprit could just as easily be Sir William, the dead man's younger brother. It is no secret that Sir William covets the Fitzalan estate - but would he kill to inherit it? The possibilities are endless, but the truth is more terrible than anyone could have imagined.

Blurb: Things just keep getting better and better. ... Well, don't they? If you are a woman and you live in China, to answer this question you will need not only to look around you but to look back, to see not just how things are now but how they once were. China has traveled a long and torturous road since the collapse of the final imperial dynasty and the establishment of a modern republic early in this century; but have the nature of women's lives and their opportunities for just and equal treatment improved? Renowned writer Gu Hua confronts this issue in Virgin Widows, a poignant and disquieting novel that unfolds in alternating chapters the stories of two women whose lives, despite being separated by nearly a century, reveal a disturbing similarity. ,First published in China in 1985, it appears now in English for the first time.

Blurb: She was born on a bitterly cold December night in 1626 and, in the candlelight, mistakenly declared a boy. On her father's death six years later, she inherited the Swedish throne. She was tutored by Descartes, yet could swear like the roughest soldier. She was painted a lesbian, a prostitute, a hermaphrodite, and an atheist; in that tumultuous age, it is hard to determine which was the most damning label. She was learned but restless, progressive yet self-indulgent; her leadership was erratic, her character unpredictable. Sweden was too narrow for her ambition. No sooner had she enjoyed the lavish celebrations of her officialcoronation at twenty-three than she abdicated, converting to Catholicism (an act of almost foolhardy independence and political challenge) and leaving her cold homeland behind for an extravagant new life in Rome. Christina, Queen of Sweden, longed fatally for adventure.,Freed from her crown, Christina cut a breath-taking path across Europe: spending madly, searching for a more prestigious throne to scale, stirring trouble wherever she went. Supported and encouraged in turn by the pope, the king of Spain, and France's powerful Cardinal Mazarin, Christina settled at the luxurious Palazzo Farnese, where she established a lavish salon for Rome's artists and intellectuals. More than once the cross-dressing queen was forced to leave town until a scandal died down. She loved to buckle on a sword and swagger like the men whose company she adored, but the greatest mystery in her life was the true nature of her elusive sexuality, which biographer Veronica Buckley explores with sensitivity and rigor. For a time it seemed there was nothing this extraordinary woman might fear attempting, until a bloody tragedy of her own making foreshadowed her downfall.,Pairing painstaking research with a sparkling narrative voice and unerring sense of the age, Veronica Buckley reclaims a protean life that had been preserved mostly as myth. Christina was a child of her time, and her time was one of great change: Europe stood at a crossroads where religion and science, antiquity and modernity, peace and war all met. Christina took what she wanted from each to create the life she most desired, and she dazzled all who met her.

Blurb: The impact of Europe on the newly-discovered world of America has long been a subject of historical fascination. But the impact of that discovery and conquest for the European conquering powers has traditionally received less attention. In this pioneering book J.H. Elliott set out to show how traditional European assumptions about geography, theology, history and the nature of man were challenged by the encounter with new lands and people; trading relationships around the world were affected by an influx of gold and silver imports from America; while politically, the sources of power were no longer confined to European territory. The 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery has prompted renewed enquiry into the relationship of the Old World and the New; John Elliott's fascinating and now classic account is here reissued with a foreword addressing the significance of its insights for a new generation of readers.

Blurb: The first Lake District steamers were designed to serve the numerous villages and settlements along the side of the lakes. From the 1860s, larger railway-owned steamers such as the Swan, Tern, Swift and Teal were built to cater for the rapidly expanding tourist market of Windermere. Elsewhere, Ullswater had the Lady of the Lake and Raven, and Coniston had magnificent steamers such as Gondola. Many of these wonderful and nostalgic lake steamers survive to this day. Andrew Gladwell tells the history of the steamers and launches used on all of the Lake District's bodies of water, and the wonderful images show the changing scenery of Lakeland as well as the numerous vessels which once steamed the Lakes, and those that remain today. He is one of Britain's acknowledged experts on pleasure steamers and has written numerous books on pleasure steamers around the coasts of Great Britain.

Blurb: In the introduction to the first edition of Witches, Ghosts, and Signs: Folklore of the Southern Appalachians, Dr. Patrick W. Gainer wrote, "The material presented in this volume has been collected from people in West Virginia over the last half-century. Long before the tape recorder came into use, I was writing down all kinds of traditional lore as I traveled over the hills and through the hollows of the mountain state.",Witches, Ghosts, and Signs: Folklore of the Southern Appalachians was first published in 1975 and is the only work thus far to catalog portions of the extensive tradition of folk cures, nature lore, and agricultural signs, as well as a number of witch-tales and ghost-tales. Gainer describes bean stringings, quilting bees, play parties, and infares along with other, more recognizable social occasions such as Christmas and Halloween. These descriptions are extremely valuable to aid our understanding of the textual material that might be passed on at such times. Taken together, Dr. Gainer's material makes the days and atmosphere of long ago come alive and immediate. Even as radio, television and easier travel between communities today tend to standardize speech and tradition, Dr. Gainer's carefully collected and preserved folklore lets readers comprehend more fully what sets the people of Southern Appalachia so proudly apart from the rest of the country.,About the Author:,Patrick W. Gainer, Professor Emeritus of English at West Virginia University, is widely renowned as a collector of folklore, as a musician, educator, and founder of the West Virginia Folk Festival at Glenville

Blurb: "Man on Upper West Side Attempts Foolhardy Stunt. Read All About It.",In the tradition of Charles Sopkin's classic book on the state of television in the 1960s, ,Seven Glorious Days, Seven Fun-Filled Nights,, Jack Lechner recounts what it was like to lock himself in his apartment for a week and plug in to the new multichannel universe, watching twelve TVs for sixteen hours a day. The obvious question is: Why?,In the thirty-three years since Sopkin's famous experiment, the quaint world of three networks and a handful of independent stations has morphed into a surfable, endless wave of infomercials and infotainment, A&E and MTV, occasional brilliance like The Simpsons and The Sopranos, and a vaster-than-ever wasteland of Jerry Springer, wrestling, soap operas, and other mind-numbing fodder. The world and television have changed a lot since 1967, and a week of television immersion at the turn of the century proves to be equally revealing about the state of American popular culture now.,With his pet pug Cosmo's unflinching emotional support, his wife Sam's more tenuous forbearance, and advice from "experts" who drop by (a five-year-old for the scoop on Pokmon, for instance), Jack Lechner plops himself down in his New York apartment and, in brave human guinea pig tradition, lets everything from Meet the Press to Xena: Warrior Princess, from beach volleyball to Bob Dole's erectile dysfunction, have its way with his impressionable psyche. As the week progresses, he explores the limits of the media universe -- watching all three network news shows simultaneously, diving into the bizarre waters of public access programming, and even conducting a playoff between the Disney Channel and the Playboy Channel. His observations are perceptive, surprising, and dead-on., ,By week's end, Lechner emerges bloody but unbowed, thankful he survived. "I was like the proverbial guy who banged himself over the head repeatedly with a hammer because it felt so good when he stopped. Watching a week of television isn't a mental health regimen I'd recommend to everyone, but it worked for me." This book is his lab report -- hilarious and a little bit scary, a trenchant comment on our media-soaked society.

Blurb: This is a groundbreaking book about the history and principles of Ethiopic (Ge'ez), an African writing system designed as a meaningful and graphic representation of a wide array of knowledge, including languages. In this important and unique study, Ayele Bekerie argues that Ethiopic is a component of the African Knowledge Systems and one of the signal contributions made by Africans to world history and cultures. The author further elaborates that Ethiopic is a knowledge system which is brilliantly organized to represent philosophical features, such as ideography, mnemonics, syllography, astronomy, and grammatology. Moreover, Ethiopic is not only a cultural agency, but a foundation to a great literary tradition in Ethiopia, which, for instance, has made a critical contribution to the history of Christianity by organically preserving The Book of Henok, which is widely held by Biblical scholars to be a precursor of Christianity. In a sharp departure from the established view of most Ethiopianists of the old school, Ayele Bekerie contends that the Ethiopic writing system is much older than has been previously thought, tracing back its origins to a period of at least 2,000 B.C.E. This study also explores the dynamic linkage between the Ethiopic and Egyptian writing systems, suggesting the possible relationship between all African writing systems of the Nile Valley.

Blurb: Chanticleer, a forty-eight-acre garden on Philadelphia's historic Main Line, is many things simultaneously: a lush display of verdant intensity and variety, an irreverent and informal setting for inventive plant combinations, a homage to the native trees and horticultural heritage of the mid-Atlantic, a testament to one man's devotion to his family's estate and legacy, and a good spot for a stroll and picnic amid the blooms. In ,Chanticleer: A Pleasure Garden,, Adrian Higgins and photographer Rob Cardillo chronicle the garden's many charms over the course of two growing cycles.,Built on the grounds of the Rosengarten estate in Wayne, Pennsylvania, Chanticleer retains a domestic scale, resulting in an intimate, welcoming atmosphere. The structure of the estate has been thoughtfully incorporated into the garden's overall design, such that small gardens created in the footprint of the old tennis court and on the foundation of one of the family homes share space with more traditional landscapes woven around streams and an orchard.,Through conversations and rambles with Chanticleer's team of gardeners and artisans, Higgins follows the garden's development and reinvention as it changes from season to season, rejoicing in the hundred thousand daffodils blooming on the Orchard Lawn in spring and marveling at the Serpentine's late summer crop of cotton, planted as a reminder of Pennsylvania's agrarian past. Cardillo's photographs reveal further nuances in Chanticleer's landscape: a rare and venerable black walnut tree near the entrance, pairs of gaily painted chairs along the paths, a backlit arbor draped in mounds of fragrant wisteria. Chanticleer fuses a strenuous devotion to the beauty and health of its plantings with a constant dedication to the mutability and natural energy of a living space. And within the garden, Higgins notes, there is a thread of perfection entwined with whimsy and continuous renewal.

Blurb: The Latin language is popularly imagined in a number of specific ways: as a masculine language, an imperial language, a classical language, a dead language. This book considers the sources of these metaphors and analyzes their effect on how Latin literature is read. By reading with and more commonly against these metaphors, the book offers a different view of Latin as a language and as a vehicle for cultural practice. The argument ranges over a variety of texts in Latin and texts about Latin from antiquity to the twentieth century.

Blurb: Even the most pious Jew need not shed so many tears over the destruction of Jerusalem as the women were in the habit of shedding when Stempenyu was playing.,The first work of Sholom Aleichems to be translated into Englishthis long out-of-print translation is the only one ever done under Aleichems personal supervisionStempenyu is a prime example of the author s hallmark traits: his antic and often sardonic sense of humor, his whip-smart dialogue, his workaday mysticism, and his historic documentation of shtetl life., Held recently by scholars to be the story that inspired Marc Chagalls Fiddler on the Roof painting (which in turn inspired the play that was subsequently based on Aleichems Tevye stories, not this novella), Stempenyu is the hysterical story of a young village girl who falls for a wildly popular klezmer fiddlera character based upon an actual Yiddish musician whose fame set off a kind of pop hysteria in the shtetl. Thus the story, in this contemporaneous authorized translation, is a wonderful introduction to Aleichems work as he wanted it read, not to mention to the unique palaver of a nineteenth-century Yiddish rock star.

Blurb: It takes more than whimsy for a giant airline to ground a multimillion-dollar jumbo jet. What the renowned investigative writer John Fuller stumbled upon was a jet-age ghost story  crews wouldnt fly the plane because of the reappearing apparitions of a dead pilot and flight engineer from a crashed sister ship. It was the famed Lockheed Tristar; the first jumbo jet ever to crash, in the Florida Everglades, with the loss of 101 persons.,In his investigation into this amazing story, John G. Fuller is led inexorably not only to repeated eyewitness experiences of the dead mens reappearances before flight crews, but also to his own personal conviction of a spiritual immortality, of life after death.,Fullers book is a true-life suspense thriller. After a classic reconstruction of the mysterious crash itself, Fuller interviews scores of airlines flight personnel and explores every facet of every ghost report. A rigorous skeptic who has always written with professional thoroughness on both scientific subjects and subjects on the frontiers of life, Fuller uncovers startling evidence of contact with the spirit of the dead flight engineer Don Repo. It is a spine-tingling, persuasive account with implications of spiritual realities that are of increasing interest in todays world of ever more extraordinary scientific breakthroughs.

Following a close-run battle between life and death after being stung by a poisonous jelly fish, the mysterious someone--Kensuke--allows Michael into his world and they become friends, teaching and learning from each other, until the day of separation becomes inevitable.,Morpurgo here spins a yarn which gently captures the adventurous elements one would expect from a desert-island tale, but the real strength lies in the poignant and subtle observations of friendship, trust and, ultimately, humanity. ,Beautifully illustrated by Michael Foreman, ,Kensuke's Kingdom, is a stylish, deceptively simple and magical book that will effortlessly capture the heart and imagination of anyone who reads it, ensuring that Morpurgo continues to stand tall amid the ranks of classic children's authors.

Blurb: Though many factors have been proposed to explain the failure of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign, it has also been linked to something as small as a button - a tin button, the kind that fastened everything from the greatcoats of Napoleon's officers to the trousers of his foot soldiers. When temperatures drop below 56F, tin crumbles into powder. Were the soldiers of the Grande Arme acutee fatally weakened by cold because the buttons of their uniforms fell apart? How different our world might be if tin did not disintegrate at low temperatures and the French had continued their eastward expansion! , This fascinating book tells the stories of seventeen molecules that, like the tin of those buttons, greatly influenced the course of history. These molecules provided the impetus for early exploration and made possible the ensuing voyages of discovery. They resulted in grand feats of engineering and spurred advances in medicine; lie behind changes in gender roles, in law, and in the environment; and have determined what we today eat, drink, and wear. , Showing how a change as small as the position of an atom can lead to enormous differences in the properties of a substance, the authors reveal the astonishing chemical connections among seemingly unrelated events. ,Napoleon's Buttons, offers a novel way to understand how our contemporary world works and how our civilization has been shaped over time.

Blurb: It was a modern thriving economy one day, and then, suddenly, the food disappeared from the shelves, the banks closed, and the ships stopped arriving. Iceland in 2008 experienced an unprecedented economic meltdown that struck fear in the hearts of people all over the world. If it could happen here, it could happen anywhere.,The economic crisis led to a political crisis, with resignations galore. The whining and wailing about the disaster continues to this day, with most commentators blaming deregulation and the free market.,In Deep Freeze, economists Philipp Bagus and David Howden demonstrate that the real cause of the calamity was bad central bank policy. Rates were way too low, banks were too big to fail, housing was implicitly guaranteed, and banks were borrowing short term from abroad to finance long term bonds.,The authors discuss the implications of this maturity mismatching and zero in on the central bank policies that encouraged unsound practices. They demonstrate the cause and effect without a shadow of a doubt, using vast amounts of data and a detailed sector-by-sector look at the economy of Iceland.,What they find is another instance of the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle, working itself out in a way that is customized for a time and place.,Toby Baxendale writes the introducton to this story that reads like a great novel. It serves as a reminder that central banking policies aren't just about monetary arcana. They affect our lives in profound and sometimes catastrophic ways.,The Iceland Freeze is one of the great historical cases that makes Misess point. Let it always serve as a reminder of what happens when the laws of the market are papered over by politicians and central bankers.,This account is likely to remain the definitive one for many years.,Copied From:,http://mises.org/document/6137/Deep-F...

Blurb: At the 1984 Olympics, American Scott Hamilton skated into the history books when he claimed a gold medal in Sarajevo. Beside him the entire time was his coach, Don Laws. A member of the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame and a U.S. Junior Champion, Laws is one of the most respected and admired ice skating coaches in the world. In addition to Hamilton, Don was the coach of champions Michael Weiss and Patrick Chan. This authorized biography tells the story of Law's exemplary life and chronicles his singular dedication to figure skating.,Don Laws: The Life of an Olympic Figure Skating Coach recounts Don's youth, from his childhood in Washington, D.C. to his Junior Men's Figure Skating Championship to his triumphs as a coach on the international stage. Featuring personal interviews with many of his former pupils, this humorous and enlightening biography captures Don's dedication to the sport and to his students. In addition, this book goes behind the scenes of the controversial new judging system--for which Laws was one of only four coaches worldwide to take part in its creation--as well as touches upon the break between Don Laws and his star pupil, Patrick Chan.,Including exclusive interviews with Scott Hamilton, Michael Weiss, premier Russian coach Tamara Moskvina, former International Skating Union member Sonia Bianchetti, and current ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta, this book is a one-of-a-kind look at a man who never broke from his beliefs and ideals and never wavered in his love for the sport. A chapter devoted to skating techniques laid out by Laws will be a helpful tool for figure skating coaches; but for the figure skater, and for any fan of the sport, it will be the stories, interviews, photographs, and history that make this book entertaining and inspiring.--Scott Hamilton, Olympic Gold Medalist

One summer, on a canoe trip four of them make into the Arctic wilderness (following in the steps of the legendary Englishman John Hornby, who, along with his small party, starved to death in the barrens in 1927), they find the balance of love shifting, much as the balance of power in the North is being changed by the proposed Mackenzie Valley gas pipeline, which threatens to displace Native people from their land.,Elizabeth Hay has been compared to Annie Proulx, Alice Hoffman, and Isabel Allende, yet she is uniquely herself. With unforgettable characters, vividly evoked settings, in this new novel, Hay brings to bear her skewering intelligence into the frailties of the human heart and her ability to tell a spellbinding story. Written in gorgeous prose, laced with dark humour, ,Late Nights on Air, is Hays most seductive and accomplished novel yet.

Blurb: Polygamy, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, punishing women for being raped, differential access for men and women to health care and education, unequal rights of ownership, assembly, and political participation, unequal vulnerability to violence. These practices and conditions are standard in some parts of the world. Do demands for multiculturalism  and certain minority group rights in particular  make them more likely to continue and to spread to liberal democracies? Are there fundamental conflicts between our commitment to gender equity and our increasing desire to respect the customs of minority cultures or religions? In this book, the eminent feminist Susan Moller Okin and fifteen of the world's leading thinkers about feminism and multiculturalism explore these unsettling questions in a provocative, passionate, and illuminating debate.,Okin opens by arguing that some group rights can, in fact, endanger women. She points, for example, to the French government's giving thousands of male immigrants special permission to bring multiple wives into the country, despite French laws against polygamy and the wives' own bitter opposition to the practice. Okin argues that if we agree that women should not be disadvantaged because of their sex, we should not accept group rights that permit oppressive practices on the grounds that they are fundamental to minority cultures whose existence may otherwise be threatened.,In reply, some respondents reject Okin's position outright, contending that her views are rooted in a moral universalism that is blind to cultural difference. Others quarrel with Okin's focus on gender, or argue that we should be careful about which group rights we permit, but not reject the category of group rights altogether. Okin concludes with a rebuttal, clarifying, adjusting, and extending her original position. These incisive and accessible essays  expanded from their original publication in ,Boston Review, and including four new contributions  are indispensable reading for anyone interested in one of the most contentious social and political issues today.,The diverse contributors, in addition to Okin, are ,Azizah al-Hibri,, ,Abdullahi An-Na'im,, ,Homi Bhabha,, ,Sander Gilman,, Janet Halley, ,Bonnie Honig,, ,Will Kymlicka,, ,Martha Nussbaum,, ,Bhikhu Parekh,, ,Katha Pollitt,, ,Robert Post,, ,Joseph Raz,, ,Saskia Sassen,, ,Cass Sunstein,, and ,Yael Tamir,.

Blurb: From Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Paul Ingrassia comes a narrative of America like no other: a cultural history that explores how cars have both propelled and reflected the national experiencefrom the Model T to the Prius., ,From the assembly lines of Henry Ford to the open roads of Route 66, from the lore of Jack Kerouac to the sex appeal of the Hot Rod, Americas history is a vehicular historyan idea brought brilliantly to life in this major work by Pulitzer Prizewinning journalist Paul Ingrassia. ,Ingrassia offers a wondrous epic in fifteen automobiles, including the Corvette, the Beetle, and the Chevy Corvair, as well as the personalities and tales behind them: Robert McNamaras unlikely role in Lee Iacoccas Mustang, John Z. DeLoreans Pontiac GTO , Henry Fords Model T, as well as Hondas Accord, the BMW 3 Series, and the Jeep, among others. ,Through these cars and these characters, Ingrassia shows how the car has expressed the particularly American tension between the lure of freedom and the obligations of utility. He also takes us through the rise of American manufacturing, the suburbanization of the country, the birth of the hippie and the yuppie, the emancipation of women, and many more fateful episodes and eras, including the cars unintended consequences: trial lawyers, energy crises, and urban sprawl. Narrative history of the highest caliber, ,Engines of Change ,is an entirely edifying new way to look at the American story.

Pencil studies of a much-younger Wendy and a serpentlike sea witch reveal the many imaginative iterations that animators create before they ultimately perfect every hero and villain. And comprehensive studies of Mickey and Baloo showcase the dedication that goes into defining the facial expressions and body language of each beloved character.,Films and shorts from throughout the history of the company are featured-beginning with ,Steamboat Willie, and ending with ,Tangled,-demonstrating the ingenuity and skill that have remained a constant at Walt Disney Animation Studios since 1928.

Learn what they are, and what you can do about it.,Sometimes were tempted to wonder if God can hear us. After months or even years of praying over a particular person or situation, we look for evidence that God is getting our message or even paying attention, and we can't find much. Why is that? Why do the heavens sometimes seem as hard and reflective as brass? Doesnt God love us and care for us? Isnt he all-powerful? Whats going on?,In Brass Heavens author, pastor, and biblical counselor Paul Tautges grounds prayer in the character of our Triune God whose very nature is to share generously his good gifts with his children. Upon that foundation, he then explores six reasons why at times God appears to go silent. As we examine these causes of unanswered prayer, we discover the biblical means by which we may open Gods ears to our voice once again.,God has a good and holy purpose for periods of silence. He wants to test our faith that we might see for ourselves just how weak and dependent we are on him for all good things. His goal is nothing less than to heighten our spiritual sensitivities in order to draw us into more intimate fellowship with him and more faithful obedience to him.

Blurb: There are many ways to try to improve our lives--we can turn to the wisdom of philosophers, the teachings of religions, or the latest experiments of psychologists. But we rarely to look to history for inspiration--and when we do, it can be surprisingly powerful.,Showing the lessons that can be learned from the past, cultural historian Roman Krznaric explores twelve universal topics, from work and love to money and creativity, and reveals the wisdom that we've been missing. There is much to be learned from Ancient Greece on relationships, from the industrial revolution on job satisfaction, and from Ming-dynasty China on bringing up our children.,Just as a Renaissance "Wunderkammer" was a curiosity cabinet full of fascinating objects, each with a story behind it, ,The Wonderbox, is full of stories and ideas from history, each of which sheds invaluable light on the decisions we make every day, whether we think about the different uses of the senses or changing attitudes to time.,History is usually read for pleasure or for insight into current affairs, but ,The Wonderbox,, stepping into the territory of Alain de Botton and Theodore Zeldin, is "practical history"--using the past to think about our day-to-day lives.

Blurb: It is New Years Eve, 1969. The narrator, an internationally renowned writer in his forties and a self-proclaimed Don Juan, meets the beautiful American movie actress Diana Soren at a party and is fascinated by her elusive charm. But infatuation becomes doomed pursuit as Diana spurns him and flees into an intrigue of paranoia and sexual jealousy. An extraordinary exploration of love, lust, betrayal, and humiliation, Diana is also a powerfully affecting novel about a vital moment in the chronicle of our times, a crucial intersection of history and art; salvation was no longer to be found in literature, and love was thwarted by the very forces that nourished it. " Fuentes is a masterful writer... A work of radical doubt and disillusion that offers a multiplicity of unanswerable questions... You'll be rewarded by this superbly vigorous mongrel of a book."

Blurb: The first novel to be released in The Foreworld Saga, ,The Mongoliad: Book One,, is an epic-within-an-epic, taking place in 13th century. In it, a small band of warriors and mystics raise their swords to save Europe from a bloodthirsty Mongol invasion. Inspired by their leader (an elder of an order of warrior monks), they embark on a perilous journey and uncover the history of hidden knowledge and conflict among powerful secret societies that had been shaping world events for millennia.,But the saga reaches the modern world via a circuitous route. In the late 19th century, Sir Richard F. Burton, an expert on exotic languages and historical swordsmanship, is approached by a mysterious group of English martial arts aficionados about translating a collection of long-lost manuscripts. Burton dies before his work is finished, and his efforts were thought lost until recently rediscovered by a team of amateur archaeologists in the ruins of a mansion in Trieste, Italy. From this collection of arcana, the incredible tale of ,The Mongoliad, was recreated.,Full of high adventure, unforgettable characters, and unflinching battle scenes, ,The Mongoliad, ignites a dangerous quest where willpower and blades are tested and the scope of world-building is redefined.,A note on this edition:, ,The Mongoliad, began as a social media experiment, combining serial story-telling with a unique level of interaction between authors and audience during the creative process.

Blurb: In ,Art: A New History,, Paul Johnson turns his great gifts as a world historian to a subject that has enthralled him all his life: the history of art. This narrative account, from the earliest cave paintings up to the present day, has new things to say about almost every period of art. Taking account of changing scholarship and shifting opinions, he draws our attention to a number of neglected artists and styles, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, Russia and the Americas.,Paul Johnson puts the creative originality of the individual at the heart of his story. He pays particular attention to key periods: the emergence of the artistic personality in the Renaissance, the new realism of the early seventeenth century, the discovery of landscape painting as a separate art form, and the rise of ideological art. He notes the division of 'fashion art' and fine art at the beginning of the twentieth century, and how it has now widened.,Though challenging and controversial, Paul Johnson is not primarily a revisionist. He is a passionate lover of beauty who finds creativity in many places. With 300 colour illustrations, this book is vivid, evocative and immensely readable, whether the author is describing the beauty of Egyptian low-relief carving or the medieval cathedrals of Europe, the watercolours of Thomas Girtin or the utility of Roman bridges ('the best bridges in history'), the genius of Andrew Wyeth or the tranquility of the Great Mosque at Damascus, the paintings of Ilya Repin or a carpet-page from the Lindisfarne Gospels. The warmth and enthusiasm of Paul Johnson's descriptions will send readers hurrying off to see these wonders for themselves.

Blurb: A fascinating cultural exploration of the history of depression and melancholy, Demontrates the changing nature of the condition - it was viewed at various periods as fashionable and a malady of the elite, as closely linked with insanity, and now as a purely biochemical condition, Engages with contemporary debates relating to diagnosis and treatment, such as the use of drugs or behavioural therapies,Depression is an experience known to millions. But arguments rage on aspects of its definition and its impact on societies present and past: do drugs work, or are they merely placebos? Is the depression we have today merely a construct of the pharmaceutical industry? Is depression under- or over-diagnosed? Should we be paying for expensive 'talking cure' treatments like psychoanalysis or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy?,Here, Clark Lawlor argues that understanding the history of depression is important to understanding its present conflicted status and definition. While it is true that our modern understanding of the word 'depression' was formed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the condition was originally known as melancholia, and characterised by core symptoms of chronic causeless sadness and fear. Beginning in the Classical period, and moving on to the present, Lawlor shows both continuities and discontinuities in the understanding of what we now call depression, and in the way it has been represented in literature and art. Different cultures defined and constructed melancholy and depression in ways sometimes so different as to be almost unrecognisable.,Even the present is still a dynamic history, in the sense that the 'new' form of depression, defined in the 1980s and treated by drugs like Prozac, is under attack by many theories that reject the biomedical model and demand a more humanistic idea of depression - one that perhaps returns us to a form of melancholy.

Yet as Arlie Russell Hochschild shows in ,The Outsourced Self,, that is no longer the case: everything that was once part of private lifelove, friendship, child rearingis being transformed into packaged expertise to be sold back to confused, harried Americans.,Drawing on hundreds of interviews and original research, Hochschild follows the incursions of the market into every stage of intimate life. From dating services that train you to be the CEO of your love life to wedding planners who create a couple's "personal narrative"; from nameologists (who help you name your child) to wantologists (who help you name your goals); from commercial surrogate farms in India to hired mourners who will scatter your loved one's ashes in the ocean of your choiceHochschild reveals a world in which the most intuitive and emotional of human acts have become work for hire.,Sharp and clear-eyed, Hochschild is full of sympathy for overstressed, outsourcing Americans, even as she warns of the market's threat to the personal realm they are striving so hard to preserve.

Blurb: In 1945, after his capture at the end of the Second World War, Hermann Gring arrived at an American-run detention center in war-torn Luxembourg, accompanied by sixteen suitcases and a red hatbox. The suitcases contained all manner of paraphernalia: medals, gems, two cigar cutters, silk underwear, a hot water bottle, and the equivalent of 1 million in cash. Hidden in a coffee can, a set of brass vials housed glass capsules containing a clear liquid and a white precipitate: potassium cyanide. Joining Gring in the detention center were the elite of the captured Nazi regimeGrand Admiral Dnitz; armed forces commander Wilhelm Keitel and his deputy Alfred Jodl; the mentally unstable Robert Ley; the suicidal Hans Frank; the pornographic propagandist Julius Streicherfifty-two senior Nazis in all, of whom the dominant figure was Gring.,To ensure that the villainous captives were fit for trial at Nuremberg, the US army sent an ambitious army psychiatrist, Captain Douglas M. Kelley, to supervise their mental well-being during their detention. Kelley realized he was being offered the professional opportunity of a lifetime: to discover a distinguishing trait among these arch-criminals that would mark them as psychologically different from the rest of humanity. So began a remarkable relationship between Kelley and his captors, told here for the first time with unique access to Kelley's long-hidden papers and medical records.,Kelley's was a hazardous quest, dangerous because against all his expectations he began to appreciate and understand some of the Nazi captives, none more so than the former Reichsmarshall, Hermann Gring. Evil had its charms.

Blurb: Sambhaji, the young king, the Second Maratha Chhatrapati who succeeded the throne after his father the great Shivaji Maharaj, continuously fought the Mughals for eight consecutive years, but did not let the Moghul army capture either any of the Maratha forts or any of the ships. He offered himself but did not bow down in front of the Mughal Emperor; he died a hero`s death at a very young age, when he was just 32 years old. For the past 325 years, Sambhaji was often painted in black. He had a poetic mind, he was a very intelligent person, he was concerned about his people, he was brave, he was a great thinker, but all his good qualities were over-looked; his personality was always looked upon with suspicion. Vishwas Patil, the most gifted author today, tells us more about Sambhaji Raje, as he has seen him through the references in history, as he has found him in the very valuable yet ignored documents, as he has heard him in the hilly regions of Sahyadri mountain ranges, among the creeks of the Arabian sea. Sambhaji, son of Shivaji Maharaj, a novel personality with his equally impressive, breath-taking, spectacular, stormy yet very true story.

Blurb: Luigi Russolo (18851947)painter, composer, builder of musical instruments, and first-hour member of the Italian Futurist movementwas a crucial figure in the evolution of twentieth-century aesthetics. As creator of the first systematic poetics of noise and inventor of what has been considered the first mechanical sound synthesizer, Russolo looms large in the development of twentieth-century music. In the first English language study of Russolo, Luciano Chessa emphasizes the futurists interest in the occult, showing it to be a leitmotif for his life and a foundation for his art of noises. Chessa shows that Russolos aesthetics of noise, and the machines he called the ,intonarumori,, were intended to boost practitioners into higher states of spiritual consciousness. His analysis reveals a multifaceted man in whom the drive to keep up with the latest scientific trends coexisted with an embrace of the irrational, and a critique of materialism and positivism.

Blurb: Most modern prejudice against biblical miracle reports depends on David Hume's argument that uniform human experience precluded miracles. Yet current research shows that human experience is far from uniform. In fact, hundreds of millions of people today claim to have experienced miracles. New Testament scholar Craig Keener argues that it is time to rethink Hume's argument in light of the contemporary evidence available to us. This wide-ranging and meticulously researched two-volume study presents the most thorough current defense of the credibility of the miracle reports in the Gospels and Acts. Drawing on claims from a range of global cultures and taking a multidisciplinary approach to the topic, Keener suggests that many miracle accounts throughout history and from contemporary times are best explained as genuine divine acts, lending credence to the biblical miracle reports.

Blurb: Naturalistic Occultism: An Introduction to Scientific Illuminism is an attempt to introduce the approach of Scientific Illuminism to occultism. It is in line with the motto of Scientific Illuminism, "The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion." Naturalistic Occultism approaches the theory and practice of occultism in a way that is scientific (using the scientific method and being up-to-date in current scientific knowledge), naturalistic (not supernatural), and pragmatic (whatever works is provisionally 'true'). This book represents an honest attempt to separate the gold of the practice of magick from the dross of superstition and dogma.

Blurb: One of the most famous - yet least understood - manifestations of Thelemic thought has been the works of Kenneth Grant, the British occultist and one-time intimate of Aleister Crowley, who discovered a hidden world within the primary source materials of Crowley's Aeon of Horus. Using complementary texts from such disparate authors as H.P. Lovecraft, Jack Parsons, Austin Osman Spare, and Charles Stansfeld Jones ("Frater Achad"), Grant formulated a system of magic that expanded upon that delineated in the rituals of the OTO: a system that included elements of Tantra, of Voudon, and in particular that of the Schlangekraft recension of the Necronomicon, all woven together in a dark tapestry of power and illumination.,The Dark Lord, follows the themes in the writings of Kenneth Grant, H.P. Lovecraft, and the Necronomicon, uncovering further meanings of the concepts of the famous writers of the Left Hand Path. It is for Thelemites, as well as lovers of the Lovecraft Mythos in all its forms, and for those who find the rituals of classical ceremonial magic inadequate for the New Aeon.,Traveling through the worlds of religion, literature, and the occult, Peter Levenda takes his readers on a deeply fascinating exploration on magic, evil, and ,The Dark Lord, as he investigates of one of the most neglected theses in the history of modern occultism: the nature of the Typhonian Current and its relationship to Aleister Crowley's Thelema and H.P. Lovecraft's Necronomicon.

Blurb: More than a how-to book, Creating a Life with God offers an opportunity to learn and adopt different types of prayer practices. Some of the prayer practices include creativity, journaling, the general practice of solitude and silence, and the Jesus prayer. The first chapter focuses on the Desert Mothers and Fathers to describe the general practices of solitude and silence. The second chapter describes the practice of Lectio Divina (or praying the scripture). The next five chapters describe prayer practices that focus on the use of the mind to come to know God. Chapters 8 and 9 move beyond the mind to use our bodies in prayer. The last three chapters move readers beyond themselves to show their prayerful interaction with the world. Along with these prayer practices are historical figures. Some of these are Julian of Norwich, The Pilgrim (who described the Jesus Prayer), and Ignatius of Loyola. Wolpert offers an appendix with step-by-step instructions for individuals and small groups to practice each from of prayer.

Blurb: Policy makers in the developing world are grappling with new dilemmas created by openness to trade and capital flows. What role, if any, remains for the state in promoting industrialization?

Blurb: This in-depth discussion of New Testament scholarship and the challenges of history as a whole proposes Bayess Theorem, which deals with probabilities under conditions of uncertainty, as a solution to the problem of establishing reliable historical criteria. The author demonstrates that valid historical methodsnot only in the study of Christian origins but in any historical studycan be described by, and reduced to, the logic of Bayess Theorem. Conversely, he argues that any method that cannot be reduced to this theorem is invalid and should be abandoned. ,Writing with thoroughness and clarity, the author explains Bayess Theorem in terms that are easily understandable to professional historians and laypeople alike, employing nothing more than well-known primary school math. He then explores precisely how the theorem can be applied to history and addresses numerous challenges to and criticisms of its use in testing or justifying the conclusions that historians make about the important persons and events of the past. The traditional and established methods of historians are analyzed using the theorem, as well as all the major "historicity criteria" employed in the latest quest to establish the historicity of Jesus. The author demonstrates not only the deficiencies of these approaches but also ways to rehabilitate them using Bayess Theorem. ,Anyone with an interest in historical methods, how historical knowledge can be justified, new applications of Bayess Theorem, or the study of the historical Jesus will find this book to be essential reading.

Blurb: This book describes Optimality Theory from the top down, explaining and exploring the central premises of OT and the results that follow from them. Examples are drawn from phonology, morphology, and syntax, but the emphasis throughout is on the theory rather than the examples, on understanding what is special about OT and on equipping readers to apply it, extend it, and critique it in their own areas of interest. The book's coverage extends to work on first- and second-language acquisition, phonetics and functional phonology, computational linguistics, historical linguistics, and sociolinguistics. Chapters conclude with extensive suggestions for further reading, classified by topic, and are supplemented by a massive bibliography (over 800 items).

Blurb: Saving Truth from Paradox, is an ambitious investigation into paradoxes of truth and related issues, with occasional forays into notions such as vagueness, the nature of validity, and the G: odel incompleteness theorems. Hartry Field presents a new approach to the paradoxes and provides a systematic and detailed account of the main competing approaches.,Part One examines Tarski's, Kripke's, and Lukasiewicz's theories of truth, and discusses validity and soundness, and vagueness. Part Two considers a wide range of attempts to resolve the paradoxes within classical logic. In Part Three Field turns to non-classical theories of truth that that restrict excluded middle. He shows that there are theories of this sort in which the conditionals obey many of the classical laws, and that all the semantic paradoxes (not just the simplest ones) can be handled consistently with the naive theory of truth. In Part Four, these theories are extended to the property-theoretic paradoxes and to various other paradoxes, and some issues about the understanding of the notion of validity are addressed. Extended paradoxes, involving the notion of determinate truth, are treated very thoroughly, and a number of different arguments that the theories lead to revenge problems are addressed. Finally, Part Five deals with dialetheic approaches to the paradoxes: approaches which, instead of restricting excluded middle, accept certain contradictions but alter classical logic so as to keep them confined to a relatively remote part of the language. Advocates of dialetheic theories have argued them to be better than theories that restrict excluded middle, for instance over issues related to the incompleteness theorems and in avoiding revenge problems. Field argues that dialetheists' claims on behalf of their theories are quite unfounded, and indeed that on some of these issues all current versions of dialetheism do substantially worse than the best theories that restrict excluded middle.

Blurb: This volume represents a comprehensive overview of the neuropsychology of emotion and the neural mechanisms underlying emotional processing. It draws on recent studies utilizing behavioral paradigms with normal subjects, the brain lesion approach, clinical evaluations of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, and neuroimaging techniques. The book opens with an introduction summarizing each chapter and pointing to directions for future research. The first section is on history, the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of emotion, and techniques that have been widely used to examine emotional processing- neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging. Theoretical perspectives on emotion are offered next, including psychological, social-cognitive, neurobiological, and neuropsychological models. A set of chapters on the neural substrates of emotion deals with a spectrum of emotional conditions: elation and mania, sadness and depression, anxiety and stress, anger and impulsivity, and apathy and flat affect. The book concludes with clinical implications, including a description of emotional deficits in neurological and psychiatric disorders (e.g., stroke, head injury, depression, and schizophrenia). Highlighted in this section is an overview of rehabilitative treatments and brain interventions for emotional processing deficits. This authoritative volume will be an important resource and text for neuropsychologists, clinical psychologists, speech-language pathologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, neurologists, rehabilitation specialists, and their students and trainees.

Blurb: Palermo. Un'estate caldissima. E tre poliziotti che pi diversi non si potrebbe: il questore Lobianco, severo e forte, Rosario D'Alessandro detto Sas - amante del cibo e delle donne, affetto da un curioso disturbo della lacrimazione che fa s che pianga quando si eccita - e Mar Pajno, affascinante e volitiva, relegata in un noioso commissariato di quartiere. I tre sono uniti sin dai primi anni di servizio da un'amicizia pi forte di tutto. Tanto che Mar, attratta da entrambi, ha finito per non concedersi a nessuno dei due...,Nel medesimo volgere di giorni, Sas viene incaricato di braccare un boss ricercato da anni e Mar si trova alle prese con un'indagine scottante: chi ha voluto uccidere sulla pubblica piazza uno dei pi noti penalisti palermitani? Come se non bastasse, proprio nel momento in cui i due amici avrebbero pi bisogno del suo autorevole appoggio, il questore Lobianco sembra preso da altre urgenze. Mentre il caldo avvolge ogni cosa, la barocca festa di Santa Rosalia ricopre le vie della citt dei gusci crocchianti dei babbaluci e in riva al mare si levano le preghiere del Ramadan, a Sas e Mar non resta che ritrovarsi, sera dopo sera, davanti a una tavola imbandita. "Che ti porto?" chiede lui ogni volta, "Panza e prisenza" risponde lei decisa, cio: solo te stesso e il tuo appetito. Ogni cena una ricetta, preparata da Mar e servita a Sas in un'atmosfera di speziata ambiguit. Ogni pasto un passo avanti nelle indagini e uno indietro nel gioco di seduzione sempre pi pericoloso tra lui e lei, e viceversa...,Giuseppina Torregrossa d forma a un racconto avvolgente, tinto dei colori della sua terra: nerissimo, come il buio che sembra risucchiare inesorabilmente ogni legalit, sin dai gesti pi quotidiani, e insieme rosso e profumato come un'arancia succosa.

Blurb: Lets be honest: most people are unhappy with at least some aspect of their physical appearance. Just think of all the money we spend each year trying to improve our looks! But if worrying about your appearance is getting in the way of living, maybe its time to start thinking about body image in a completely new way.,Based in proven-effective acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), Living with Your Body and Other Things You Hate offers a unique approach to addressing your struggle with body image. In this book, you will not be told that your self-perceptions are wrong, that your thoughts are irrational, or that your feelings are misguided. Instead, you will learn to live with the reality that these often painful thoughts and beliefs about yourself will arise from time to time, and that what is really important is accepting these distressing thoughts without allowing them to dominate your life.,You know what its like to constantly be checking the mirror, to avoid certain social situations where your body may be exposed, or to gaze longingly at a fashion model in a magazine and think, Why cant I be her? But what you may not know is that people who struggle with negative body image are at an increased risk for depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and low self-esteem. Body image problems can even lead to major financial issues. By focusing on your appearance and little else, you are hurting yourself in more ways than one.,If you are ready to find a purpose in life that is more important than the pain you feel about your appearance, this book provides a truthful, powerful resource.

Blurb: When you look out your window, why are you so much more likely to see a robin or a sparrow than a Kirtland's warbler or a California condor? Why are some animals naturally rare and others so abundant? The quest to find and study seldom-seen jaguars and flamboyant Andean cocks-of-the-rock is as alluring to naturalists as it is vitally important to science. From the Himalayan slopes of Bhutan to the most isolated mountain ranges of New Guinea, ,The Kingdom of Rarities, takes us to some of the least-traveled places on the planet to catch a glimpse of these unique animals and many others. As he shares stories of these species, Eric Dinerstein gives readers a deep appreciation of their ecological importance and the urgency of protecting all types of lifethe uncommon and abundant alike.,An eye-opening tour of the rare and exotic, ,The Kingdom of Rarities, offers us a new understanding of the natural world, one that places rarity at the center of conservation biology. Looking at real-time threats to biodiversity, from climate change to habitat fragmentation, and drawing on his long and distinguished scientific career, Dinerstein offers readers fresh insights into fascinating questions about the science of rarity and unforgettable experiences from the field.

Blurb: This book analyzes the discourses and deliberations in the discussion forums of three of the most visited Islamic websites. In doing so, it explores the potential impact of the Islamic public sphere and the re-configuration of the "virtual umma," the Islamic community online, on the creation of multiple identities and resistances, which manifest themselves through various Islamic sites, producing varying degrees of consensus, divergence, and negotiation in multiple contexts and across different discourses. The book also investigates the extent to which these Islamic websites have provided a venue for Muslims to freely engage in vibrant deliberations and constructive discussions among themselves, as well as with "Others," i.e., non-Muslims, about various political, economic, religious and social issues.

Blurb: Libya is coming in from the cold, but for most of the three decades following Mu'ammar al-Qadhafi's self-styled revolution in 1969, the country was politically isolated and labelled a pariah state. Dirk Vandewalle, one of only a handful of Western scholars to visit the country during this time, is intimately acquainted with Libya. He offers a lucid and comprehensive account of Libya's past, and corrects some of the misunderstandings about its present. The story begins in the 1900s with a portrait of Libya's desert terrain and the personalities that shaped its development. Professor Vandewalle then covers Libya's history during the Italian colonial period (1911-1943) and the monarchy that ruled between 1951 and 1969. He goes on to discuss the subsequent regime of Colonel Qadhafi and the economic, political, and ideological developments that he engendered. Finally, he describes the most recent events that brought Libya back into the international fold. As the first comprehensive history of Libya over the last two decades, this book will be welcomed by scholars and students of North Africa, the Middle East, and by those who are visiting and doing business in the region. Diederik (Dirk) Vandewalle is Associate Professor of Government at Dartmouth College, and former chair of its Asian and Middle Eastern Studies program. His academic specialty focuses on the political economy of North Africa, and on strategies of political and economic liberalization in the region. Vandewalle is the author of Libya Since Independence: Oil and State-building ( 1998), editor of two volumes on Libya and North Africa, and author of numerous journal articles. He has received, among a number of awards, a Fulbright and Social Science Research Council grant for his research, and has been a Visiting Scholar at the Harvard Institute of International Development and at Harvard's Center of Middle Eastern Studies.

Blurb: If you think that statistics has nothing to say about what you do or how you could do it better, then you are either wrong or in need of a more interesting job. Stephen Senn explains here how statistics determines many decisions about medical care--from allocating resources for health, to determining which drugs to license, to cause-and-effect in relation to disease. He tackles big themes: clinical trials and the development of medicines, life tables, vaccines and their risks or lack of them, smoking and lung cancer and even the power of prayer. He entertains with puzzles and paradoxes and covers the lives of famous statistical pioneers. By the end of the book the reader will see how reasoning with probability is essential to making rational decisions in medicine, and how and when it can guide us when faced with choices that impact our health and/or life. Stephen Senn has been a Professor of Pharmaceutical and Health Statistics at the University College of London since 1995. In 2001 he won George C. Challis Award of the University of Florida for contributions to biostatistics. Senn's previous two books are Statistical Issues in Drug Development (Wiley, 1997) and Cross-over Trials in Clinical Research (Wiley, 1993). He is the member of seven editorial boards including Statistics in Medicine and Pharmaceutical Statistics.

Blurb: Just before the outbreak of World War II, young Witold Gombrowicz left his home in Poland and set sail for South America. In 1953, still living as an expatriate in Argentina, he began his Diary with one of literature's most memorable openings: Monday - Me; Tuesday - Me; Wednesday - Me; and, Thursday - Me. Gombrowicz's Diary grew to become a vast collection of essays, short notes, polemics, and confessions on myriad subjects ranging from political events to literature to the certainty of death. Not a traditional journal, Diary is instead the commentary of a brilliant and restless mind.,Widely regarded as a masterpiece, this brilliant work compelled Gombrowicz's attention for a decade and a half until he penned his final entry in France, shortly before his death in 1969. Long out of print in English, Diary is now presented in a convenient single volume featuring a new preface by Rita Gombrowicz, the author's widow and literary executor. This edition also includes ten previously unpublished pages from the 1969 portion of the diary.

Bisneto pelo lado paterno de Camilo Castelo Branco, e s de muito poucos conhecido ainda, Veiga protagonizaria uma singularssima aventura potica na histria da literatura portuguesa. Apesar de se ter manifestado quase sempre refractrio  publicao dos seus escritos, e mais ou menos arredio dos movimentos da chamada vida literria, no falta quem comece a saudar em Tiago Veiga a incontestvel originalidade de uma voz, e o poderio impressionante que lhe assiste., ,A sua biografia, redigida aqui por Mrio Cludio que o conheceu pessoalmente, no deixar de configurar de resto matria de suplementar interesse pela relevncia das figuras com que Veiga se cruzou, e entre as quais se destacam poetas como Jean Cocteau e Fernando Pessoa, Edith Sitwell e Marianne Moore, Ruy Cinatti e Lus Miguel Nava, polticos como Bernardino Machado e Manuel Teixeira Gomes, pensadores como Benedetto Croce, e at simples ornamentos do mundanismo internacional como a milionria Barbara Hutton. A isto acrescer a crnica de um longo percurso de viajante civilizado, e testemunha de vrios acontecimentos significativos do seu tempo, o que, tudo junto imprimiria  sua existncia, neste livro minudentemente relatada por Mrio Cludio, uma vigorosa espessura romanesca., ,A obra de Tiago Veiga, da qual se publicariam postumamente trs ttulos apenas, e nem sequer os de maior importncia, ficar a partir de agora mais aberta  curiosidade do grande pblico. Bisneto de Camilo Castelo Branco, e autor de uma obra potica fragmentria, mas originalssima, Tiago Veiga (1900-1988) constitui caso singular na literatura portuguesa. Europeu por vocao, e interlocutor de Fernando Pessoa, Edith Sitwell, Jean Cocteau, W. B. Yeats, Benedetto Croce, Jos Rgio, Marianne Moore, ou Lus Miguel Nava, o homem aqui biografado ficar certamente como invulgar testemunha do sculo em que viveu.

Blurb: In one of the most acclaimed travel and adventure books of the past year, Rick Ridgeway chronicles his trek from the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro to the Indian Ocean, through Kenya's famed Tsavo Park. His tale is, according to ,The Boston Globe,, "a gripping account of how it feels to be charged by an incensed elephant and kept awake at night by the roaring of stalking lions." But it is more than an adventure story. ,The Los Angeles Times, noted that "the pace of walking gives Ridgeway time to contemplate his great theme and the great men and women who have struggled with the conundrum of whether man can live at peace with the beasts." Ridgeway examines the effects of colonial expansion on the indigenous people, the landscape, and the animals, and contemplates the future for all of them.

Blurb: After having lived in Taipei for ten years, Troy Parfitt sets out on an epic journey to test the theory that China is ascending toward a position of global hegemony. The result is a whirlwind tour of the Chinese world, one that enlightens, astonishes, and entertains. Parfitt shows us that he is the perfect China tour guide-the steward of an intimate knowledge of the nation's history, culture, and psyche yet not serving any interest other than an investigative one. Here is a unique and powerful book, one that will change the way people think about China and its "great rise." Why China Will Never Rule the World is a tour de force; vital for anyone wishing to understand what China is, what is has been, and what it is likely to become.

Blurb: Siena seems at first glance a typical Italian city: within its venerable medieval walls the citizens sport designer clothes, wield digital phones, and prize their dazzling local cuisine. But unlike neighboring Florence, Siena is still deeply rooted in ancient traditionschiefly the spectacular Palio, in which seventeen independent societies known as ,contrade, vie for bragging rights in an annual bareback horse race around the central piazza.,Into this strange, closed world steps Robert Rodi. A Chicago writer with few friends in town and a shaky command of conversational Italian, he couldnt be more out of place. Yet something about the sense of belonging radiating from the ritual-obsessed Sienese excites him, and draws him back to witness firsthand how their passionate brand of community extends beyond the Palio into the entire calendar year. Smitten, Rodi undertakes a plan to insinuate himself into this body politic, learn their ways, and win their acceptance.,Seven Seasons in Siena, is the story of Rodis love affair with the people of Sienaand of his awkward, heartfelt, intermittently successful, occasionally disastrous attempts to become a naturalized member of the Noble Contrada of the Caterpillar. It wont be easy. As one of the locals points out, someone whos American, gay, and a writer is the equivalent of a triple unicorn in this corner of Tuscany. But like a jockey in the Palio outlasting the competition in the home stretch, Rodi is determined to wear down all resistance. By immersing himself in the life of the contrada over seven visits at different times of the yearworkingin their kitchens, competing in their athletic events, and mastering the tangled politics of their various feuds and alliancesthe ultimate outsider slowly begins to find his way into the hearts of this proud and remarkable people.,By turns hilarious and heartwarming, and redolent with the flavor of the Tuscan countryside, ,Seven Seasons in Siena, opens a window on daily life in one of the most magical regions in all of Italyrevealing the joys to be found when we stop being spectators and start taking an active part in lifes rich pageant.

Blurb: No Other Way Out provides a powerful explanation for the emergence of popular revolutionary movements, and the occurrence of actual revolutions, during the Cold War era. This sweeping study ranges from Southeast Asia in the 1940s and 1950s to Central America in the 1970s and 1980s and Eastern Europe in 1989. Goodwin demonstrates how the actions of specific types of authoritarian regimes unwittingly channeled popular resistance into radical and often violent directions. By comparing the historical trajectories of more than a dozen countries, Goodwin also shows how revolutionaries were able to create opportunities for seizing state power.

Blurb: Widely acclaimed throughout Latin America after its 1992 release in Argentina, ,The Absent City, takes the form of a futuristic detective novel. In the end, however, it is a meditation on the nature of totalitarian regimes, on the transition to democracy after the end of such regimes, and on the power of language to create and define reality. Ricardo Piglia combines his trademark avant-garde aesthetics with astute cultural and political insights into Argentinas history and contemporary condition in this conceptually daring and entertaining work.,The novel follows Junior, a reporter for a daily Buenos Aires newspaper, as he attempts to locate a secret machine that contains the mind and the memory of a woman named Elena. While Elena produces stories that reflect on actual events in Argentina, the police are seeking her destruction because of the revelations of atrocities that shethe machineis disseminating through texts and taped recordings. The book thus portrays the race to recover the history and memory of a city and a country where history has largely been obliterated by political repression. Its narrativesall part of a detective story, all part of something moremultiply as they intersect with each other, like the streets and avenues of Buenos Aires itself. ,The second of Piglias novels to be translated by Duke University Pressthe first was ,Artifical Respiration,this book continues the authors quest to portray the abuses and atrocities that characterize dictatorships as well as the difficulties associated with making the transition to democracy. Translated and with an introduction by Sergio Waisman, it includes a new afterword by the author.

Blurb: Many semi-pro and professional wedding photographers are looking to "wake up" their style, stay current, and stimulate business. And today, that means lifestyle photography, also referred to as "fine art wedding photography." Fine art wedding photography isn't just a catchy phrase; it's a modern approach in which design is paramount. Fine art wedding images are more graphic and stylized than traditional wedding photojournalism, as if they were pulled from the pages of a glossy wedding or lifestyle magazine. ,Acclaimed wedding photographer Jose Villa was a pioneer in fine art wedding photography before it became a trendy buzzword. Here, he shares his secrets for bringing a stylized sense of composition, lighting, posing, and most important, design, to your images, while still keeping them organic and narrative. Youll learn Joses trademark technique of capturing the more natural moment ,after, a pose, and tips for getting images right in-camera to avoid the need for heavy postproduction. Final chapters show you how to integrate design through the delivered product, whether an album or slideshow, and continue nurturing clients after the wedding by expanding to baby and family portraiture. ,Packed with real-life examples, solid techniques, and stunning images from one of the wedding industry's brightest stars, this book will both educate and inspire photographers seeking to update their work and satisfy a new generation of brides.

Blurb: Lucky Peach, is a new journal of food writing, published on a quarterly basis by McSweeneys. It is a creation of David Chang, the James Beard Awardwinning chef behind the Momofuku restaurants in New York, ,Momofuku, cookbook cowriter Peter Meehan, and Zero Point Zero Productionsproducers of the Travel Channels Emmy Awardwinning ,Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations,.,The result of this collaboration is a mlange of travelogue, essays, art, photography, and rants in a full-color, meticulously designed format. Recipes will defy the tired ingredients-and-numbered-steps formula. Theyll be laid out sensibly, inspired by the thought process that went into developing them.,Each issue will focus on a theme (Issue Ones theme is Ramen), with contributions from Harold McGee, Ruth Reichl, John T. Edge, Todd Kliman and a cavalcade of other writers and artists. The reader will meander through arguments about the superiority of yellow alkaline noodles over Italian egg pasta; a taxonomy of ramen-package characters; an eating tour of Japan helmed by an over-stuffed and nauseated, but nevertheless intrepid, David Chang; and a booze-fueled rant on mediocrity in American cuisine with chefs Chang, Bourdain, and Wylie Dufresne set in the Spanish Basque country.,The aim of ,Lucky Peach, is to give a platform to a brand of food writing that began with unorthodox authors like Bourdain, resulting in a publication that appeals to diehard foodies as well as fans of good writing and art in general.

Blurb: The poems in Robert Hass's new collectionhis first to appear in a decadeare grounded in the beauty and energy of the physical world, and in the bafflement of the present moment in American culture. This work is breathtakingly immediate, stylistically varied, redemptive, and wise.,His familiar landscapes are hereSan Francisco, the Northern California coast, the Sierra high countryin addition to some of his oft-explored themes: art; the natural world; the nature of desire; the violence of history; the power and limits of language; and, as in his other books, domestic life and the conversation between men and women. New themes emerge as well, perhaps: the essence of memory and of time.,The works here look at paintings, at Gerhard Richter as well as Vermeer, and pay tribute to his particular literary masters, friend Czesaw Miosz, the great Swedish poet Tomas Transtrmer, Horace, Whitman, Stevens, Nietszche, and Lucretius. We are offered glimpses of a surprisingly green and vibrant twenty-first-century Berlin; of the demilitarized zone between the Koreas; of a Bangkok night, a Mexican desert, and an early summer morning in Paris, all brought into a vivid present and with a passionate meditation on what it is and has been to be alive. "It has always been Mr. Hass's aim," the ,New York Times Book Review, wrote, "to get the whole man, head and heart and hands and everything else, into his poetry.",Every new volume by Robert Hass is a major event in poetry, and this beautiful collection is no exception.

Considered by some to be a traitor to Ireland, and after some seven years of confinement in the County Home, Dunne is a broken man, both mentally and physically. Alone in a barren room, barely clothed and in little control of his faculties, Dunne, at 75, reenacts scenes from his past, taking refuge in the memory of his three daughters and a son who died in World War I. The parallels between Dunne's family life and the political life of Ireland are all too apparent. Chaos and murder resulted from the revolution, and Dunne could only stand watching as his way of understanding the world dissolved. Similarly, he was an aloof father who couldn't tell his son how much he loved him until it was too late. Near the end of the play, the arrival of Dunne's daughter, Annie, puts the last nail in the play's thematic coffin as her anger and resentment over her father's neglect compete with her pity for this elderly man who now needs her the way a baby needs its mother. Bereft of any solution to his life, Dunne recounts a childhood memory about his own father, in which he seems to be asking us for forgiveness and understanding.

Blurb: When insulin was discovered in the early 1920s, even jaded professionals marveled at how it brought starved, sometimes comatose diabetics back to life. In this now-classic study, Michael Bliss unearths a wealth of material, ranging from scientists& unpublished memoirs to the confidential appraisals of insulin by members of the Nobel Committee. He also resolves a longstanding controversy dating to the awarding of the Nobel to F. G. Banting and J. J. R. Macleod for their work on insulin: because each insisted on sharing the credit with an additional associate, medical opinion was intensely divided over the allotment of credit for the discovery. Bliss also offers a wealth of new detail on such subjects as the treatment of diabetes before insulin and the life-and-death struggle to manufacture it.,Bliss;s excellent account of the insulin story is a rare dissection of the anatomy of scientific discovery, and serves as a model of how rigorous historical method can correct the myths and legends sometimes perpetrated in the scientific literature.

Blurb: One day we woke up and realized that our "macaroni" had become "pasta," that our Wonder Bread had been replaced by organic whole wheat, that sushi was fast food, and that our tomatoes were heirlooms. How did all this happen, and who made it happen? The United States of Arugula is the rollicking, revealing chronicle of how gourmet eating in America went from obscure to pervasive, thanks to the contributions of some outsized, opinionated iconoclasts who couldn't abide the status quo. Vanity Fair writer David Kamp chronicles this amazing transformation, from the overcooked vegetables and scary gelatin salads of yore to our current heyday of free-range chickens, extra-virgin olive oil, Iron Chef, Whole Foods, Starbucks, and that breed of human known as the "foodie." In deft fashion, Kamp conjures up vivid images of the "Big Three," the lodestars who led us out of this culinary wilderness: James Beard, the hulking, bald, flamboyant Oregonian who made the case for American cookery; Julia Child, the towering, warbling giantess who demystified French cuisine for Americans; and Craig Claiborne, the melancholy, sexually confused Mississippian who all but invented food journalism at the New York Times. The story continues onward with candid, provocative commentary from the food figures who prospered in the Big Three's wake: Alice Waters and Jeremiah Tower of Berkeley's Chez Panisse, Wolfgang Puck and his L.A. acolytes, the visionary chefs we know by one name (Emeril, Daniel, Mario, Jean-Georges), the "Williams" in Williams-Sonoma, the "Niman" in Niman Ranch, both Dean and DeLuca, and many others. A rich, frequently uproarious stew of culinary innovation, flavor revelations, balsamic pretensions, taste-making luminaries, food politics, and kitchen confidences, The United States of Arugula is the remarkable history of the cultural success story of our era.

Blurb: This translation, supported by the Japan Foundation, makes a strong claim to be the definitive translation of the 95 chapter edition of Shobogenzo, the essential Japanese Buddhist text, written in the 13th century by Zen Master Dogen. Following on from Shobogenzo Book 1, the second book in this four volume set contains chapters 22 to 41 from the 95-chapter edition, including these well-known chapters: Bussho (Buddha Nature); Daigo (Great Realization); Gyoji (Conduct and Observance); Inmo (This); and Shinjin-gakudo (Learning the Truth with Body and Mind). Book 2 maintains the highest standards of translation, with a clear style that rigorously follows the original words of Master Dogen. Ample footnotes, including Japanese and Chinese characters, explanatory text, and cross-references to other works, provide the reader with a wealth of supplementary information. Also included are a Sanskrit glossary of terms, and a list of Pinyin equivalents to the Japanese readings of Masters' names. 'The water is clean, right down to the ground, Fishes are swimming like fishes. The sky is wide, clear through to the heavens, And birds are flying like birds. ...children and grandchildren of the Buddhist patriarchs should unfailingly learn in practice that sitting in Zazen is the one great matter. This is the authentic seal which is received and transmitted one-to-one.'

Blurb: Tsong khapa (14th-15th centuries) is arguably the most important and influential philosopher in Tibetan history. His ,Ocean of Reasoning, is the most extensive and perhaps the deepest extant commentary on N=ag=arjuna's ,M?lamadhyamakak=arik=a (Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way),, and it can be argued that it is impossible to discuss N=ag=arjuna's work in an informed way without consulting it. It discusses alternative readings of the text and prior commentaries and provides a detailed exegesis, constituting a systematic presentation of Madhyamaka Buddhist philosophy. Despite its central importance, however, of Tsong khapa's three most important texts, only ,Ocean of Reasoning, has until now remained untranslated, perhaps because it is both philosophically and linguistically challenging, demanding a rare combination of abilities on the part of a translator. Jay L. Garfield and Geshe Ngawang Samten bring the requisite skills to this difficult task, combining between them expertise in Western and Indian philosophy, and fluency in Tibetan, Sanskrit, and English. The resulting translation of this important text is not only a landmark contribution to the scholarship of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, but will be invaluable to students of Tibetan Buddhism and philosophy, who will now be able to read this work alongside N=ag=arjuna's masterpiece.

Blurb: It is widely known that such Western institutions as the museum, the university, and the penitentiary shaped Japans emergence as a modern nation-state. Less commonly recognized is the role played by the distinctly hybrid institutionat once museum, laboratory, and prisonof the zoological garden. In this eye-opening study of Japans first modern zoo, Tokyos Ueno Imperial Zoological Gardens, opened in 1882, Ian Jared Miller offers a refreshingly unconventional narrative of Japans rapid modernization and changing relationship with the natural world. As the first zoological garden in the world not built under the sway of a Western imperial regime, the Ueno Zoo served not only as a staple attraction in the nations capitalan institutional marker of national accomplishmentbut also as a site for the propagation of a new natural order that was scientifically verifiable and evolutionarily foreordained. As the Japanese empire grew, Ueno became one of the primary sites of imperialist spectacle, a microcosm of the empire that could be traveled in the course of a single day. The meaning of the zoo would change over the course of Imperial Japans unraveling and subsequent Allied occupation. Today it remains one of Japans most frequently visited places. But instead of empire in its classic political sense, it now bespeaks the ambivalent dominion of the human species over the natural environment, harkening back to its imperial roots even as it asks us to question our exploitation of the planets resources.

Blurb: This third volume continues the comprehensive revision of this era, and covers in detail the next fifty years; a very different period during which the Empire came perilously close to total disintegration under the pressure of foreign invasions and seemingly interminable civil war. The economy also collapsed and with it the Imperial coinage, a desperate situation which was only partially alleviated by the currency reform of Aurelian undertaken late in his reign. The complexities of the mint attributes in this chaotic period lacking as the do in almost instance the name or initial of the responsible mint have been dealt with in light of recent scholarship.

Blurb: Het verhaal gaat over een wonderlijke man - Japi genaamd ("Zijn achternaam heb ik nooit geweten") - die van andermans geld leeft, pakken koopt die hij nooit betaalt, en zich oefent in 'versterven'. Japi heeft slechts n ideaal, en wel dat van de volmaakte bohemien zijn. Hij wil niet eens een kunstenaar zijn. "Ik ben Goddank helemaal niks," aldus Japi. Via schilder Bavink komt hij in contact met Koekebakker, ook wel bekend als Erik de Man, de ik-persoon van het boek. Japi staat al snel te boek als een profiteur, "die je sigaren oprookte" en "paraplu's leende die hij nooit terugbracht". Vandaar zijn bijnaam: de uitvreter. Japi, Bavink (die een niet-succesvol schilder is) en Koekebakker, een journalist, verzetten zich tegen de maatschappij, waarin mensen worden uitgebuit en zij zweren langzaam maar zeker het werken af. Van hun idealen komt echter niets: Koekebakker blijft werkzaam bij zijn kantoortje en verdient daar een aardig salaris, maar verliest wel al zijn idealen. Bavink wordt een steeds tragischer figuur, die Japi op een voetstuk zet maar zelf "mal" wordt. Japi zelf weet zich ook geen blijf. Hij trekt naar Friesland, Belgi en Frankrijk, maar vindt nergens de betekenis en bevestiging die hij zoekt. Als zijn onbereikbare liefde Jeanne sterft en hij geen ideaal meer te verwezenlijken ziet, trekt hij naar Nijmegen. Later heeft Japi een baan, maar hij kan niet aarden in de burgermaatschappij - een bij Nescio regelmatig terugkerend thema - en ten slotte stapt hij van de spoorbrug over de Waal bij Nijmegen. Zijn reis naar Friesland is altijd onopgehelderd gebleven. ,[Bron: wiki]

Blurb: An examination of why paper continues to fill our offices and a proposal for better coordination of the paper and digital worlds.,Over the past thirty years, many people have proclaimed the imminent arrival of the paperless office. Yet even the World Wide Web, which allows almost any computer to read and display another computer's documents, has increased the amount of printing done. The use of e-mail in an organization causes an average 40 percent increase in paper consumption. In ,The Myth of the Paperless Office,, Abigail Sellen and Richard Harper use the study of paper as a way to understand the work that people do and the reasons they do it the way they do. Using the tools of ethnography and cognitive psychology, they look at paper use from the level of the individual up to that of organizational culture.,Central to Sellen and Harper's investigation is the concept of affordances--the activities that an object allows, or affords. The physical properties of paper (its being thin, light, porous, opaque, and flexible) afford the human actions of grasping, carrying, folding, writing, and so on. The concept of affordance allows them to compare the affordances of paper with those of existing digital devices. They can then ask what kinds of devices or systems would make new kinds of activities possible or better support current activities. The authors argue that paper will continue to play an important role in office life. Rather than pursue the ideal of the paperless office, we should work toward a future in which paper and electronic document tools work in concert and organizational processes make optimal use of both.

Blurb: The Affair of the Poisons,, as it became known, was an extraordinary episode that took place in France during the reign of Louis XIV. When poisoning and black magic became widespread, arrests followed. Suspects included those among the highest ranks of society. Many were tortured and numerous executions resulted.,The 1676 torture and execution of the Marquise de Brinvilliers marked the start of the scandal which rocked the foundations of French society and sent shock waves through all of Europe. Convicted of conspiring with her adulterous lover to poison her father and brothers in order to secure the family fortune, the marquise was the first member of the noble class to fall.,In the French court of the period, where sexual affairs were numerous, ladies were not shy of seeking help from the murkier elements of the Parisian underworld, and fortune-tellers supplemented their dubious trade by selling poison.,It was not long before the authorities were led to believe that Louis XIV himself was at risk. With the police chief of Paris police alerted, every hint of danger was investigated.

The Mistress of the Robes and a distinguished general were among the early suspects. But they paled into insignificance when the King's mistress was incriminated. If, as was said, she had engaged in vile Satanic rituals and had sought to poison a rival for the King's affections, what was Louis XIV to do?,Anne Somerset has gone back to original sources, letters and earlier accounts of the affair. By the end of her account, she reaches firm conclusions on various crucial matters. ,The Affair of the Poisons, is an enthralling account of a sometimes bizarre period in French history.

Blurb: Winner of the Lincoln Prize,Lincoln at Cooper Union, explores Lincoln's most influential and widely reported pre-presidential address -- an extraordinary appeal by the western politician to the eastern elite that propelled him toward the Republican nomination for president. Delivered in New York in February 1860, the Cooper Union speech dispelled doubts about Lincoln's suitability for the presidency and reassured conservatives of his moderation while reaffirming his opposition to slavery to Republican progressives., ,Award-winning Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer places Lincoln and his speech in the context of the times -- an era of racism, politicized journalism, and public oratory as entertainment -- and shows how the candidate framed the speech as an opportunity to continue his famous "debates" with his archrival Democrat Stephen A. Douglas on the question of slavery., ,Holzer describes the enormous risk Lincoln took by appearing in New York, where he exposed himself to the country's most critical audience and took on Republican Senator William Henry Seward of New York, the front runner, in his own backyard. Then he recounts a brilliant and innovative public relations campaign, as Lincoln took the speech "on the road" in his successful quest for the presidency.

Blurb: Core Curriculum: Writings on Photography, is the long-awaited collection of essays, reviews and lectures by Tod Papageorge, one of the most influential voices in photography today. As a photographer and the Walker Evans Professor of Photography at the Yale University School of Art, Papageorge has shaped the work and thought of generations of artist-photographers, and, through his critical writings--some of which have gained a cult following through online postings--he has earned a reputation as an unusually eloquent and illuminating guide to the work of many of the most important figures in twentieth-century photography. Among the artists Papageorge discusses in this essential volume are Eugene Atget, Brassai, Robert Frank (with Walker Evans), Robert Adams and his close friend Garry Winogrand. The book also includes texts that examine the more general questions of photography's relationship to poetry, and how the evolution of the medium's early technologies led to the twentieth- century creation of the artist-photographer. Among the previously unpublished pieces in ,Core Curriculum, are an unfinished poem written in response to Susan Sontag's ,On Photography,, a profile of Josef Koudelka and a commencement speech delivered at the Yale School of Art in 2004. ,Core Curriculum, also includes a number of interviews with this esteemed photographer/teacher/ author, ranging in topic from his own photographic work and background in poetry to his energetic observations on the art of photography.,Tod Papageorge, (born 1940) earned his BA in English literature from the University of New Hampshire in 1962, where he began taking photographs during his last semester. He is the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships and two National Endowment for the Arts Fellowships. In 1979, Papageorge was named Yale University's Walker Evans Professor of Photography and director of graduate studies in photography, both positions he continues to hold today.

Blurb: The selections contained in this volume were made by Richard Kik. The original edition Vom Licht in uns was published by Verlag J.F. Steinkopf, Stuhgart. It contains sayings of things highly spiritual nature as well as a description of the life of Richard Kik. One such selection is "The beginning of all spiritual life is fearless belief in truth and its open confession." Albert Schweitzer (14 January 1875 - 4 September 1965) was a German-French theologian, musician, philosopher, and physician. He was born in Kaysersberg in the province of Elsass-Lothringen (Alsace-Lorraine), at the time in the German Empire. Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current at his time in certain academic circles, as well the traditional Christian view, depicting a Jesus Christ who expected and predicted the imminent end of the world. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 for his philosophy of "Reverence for Life" expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Lambarn, now in Gabon, west central Africa (then French Equatorial Africa). As a music scholar and organist, he studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and influenced the Organ reform movement (Orgelbewegung). Schweitzer's passionate quest was to discover a universal ethical philosophy, anchored in a universal reality, and make it directly available to all of humanity. This is reflected in some of his sayings, such as: "Until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace." "I don't know what your destiny will be, but one thing I do know: the only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve."

Blurb: The concept of 'food as medicine' is rooted in our most ancient of traditions, including Greek, Indian and Chinese medicine. If we consider the anthropological evidence it is very likely that our hunter-gatherer ancestors learned about medicinal herbs by observing wild animals deliberately eating certain plants in their diet as a way to treat different health issues. For all of nature and throughout the history of traditional medicine there has never been any real separation between food and medicine, and the present work aims to restore this connection. Informed by the theory and practices of Ayurveda and scientific research, Food As Medicine: The Theory and Practice of Food provides a practical and lucid model of what food is, how it impacts your health, and how to make the best choices in your diet - depending on your individual needs. Includes meal plans and recipes. Todd Caldecott is a trained medical herbalist and practitioner of Ayurveda, in practice since 1997. He is a registered professional member of the American Herbalists Guild, author of the textbook Ayurveda: The Divine Science of Life, and editor of a new text on Nepalese ethnobotany called Ayurveda in Nepal. Todd lives in Vancouver B.C. with his family where he practices and teaches herbal medicine and Ayurveda.

Blurb: For readers of the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin's speech is a treasure trove of inspiration, wisdom, eloquence, and spiritual insight. King Benjamin's Speech: "That Ye May Learn Wisdom" is the most substantial collection of studies ever to focus exclusively on this landmark address. The contributors examine this speech in the multifaceted contexts in which it was delivered: as a classic speech of a departing leader near the time of his death, as the focus of an annual festival season mandated anciently under the law of Moses, as part of a covenant renewal ceremony delivered within the sacred precinct of the Nephite temple in Zarahemla, and as preparation for the coronation of a new king.,Historical and linguistic tools and information are employed in these essays to help the reader to better grasp the speech's historical setting, its doctrinal implications, its literary qualities, its influence then and now, and its overall brilliance.

Blurb: Show Boat: Performing Race in an American Musical, tells the full story of the making and remaking of the most important musical in Broadway history. Drawing on exhaustive archival research and including much new information from early draft scripts and scores, this book reveals how Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern created ,Show Boat, in the crucible of the Jazz Age to fit the talents of the show's original 1927 cast. After showing how major figures such as Paul Robeson and Helen Morgan defined the content of the show, the book goes on to detail how ,Show Boat, was altered by later directors, choreographers, and performers up to the end of the twentieth century. All the major New York productions are covered, as are five important London productions and four Hollywood versions.,Again and again, the story of ,Show Boat, circles back to the power of performers to remake the show, winning appreciative audiences for over seven decades. Unlike most Broadway musicals, ,Show Boat, put black and white performers side by side. This book is the first to take ,Show Boat,'s innovative interracial cast as the defining feature of the show. From its beginnings, ,Show Boat, juxtaposed the talents of black and white performers and mixed the conventions of white-cast operetta and the black-cast musical. Bringing black and white onto the same stage -- revealing the mixed-race roots of musical comedy -- ,Show Boat, stimulated creative artists and performers to renegotiate the color line as expressed in the American musical. This tremendous longevity allowed ,Show Boat, to enter a creative dialogue with the full span of Broadway history. ,Show Boat,'s voyage through the twentieth century offers a vantage point on more than just the Broadway musical. It tells a complex tale of interracial encounter performed in popular music and dance on the national stage during a century of profound transformations.

Blurb: During the past forty years, South Asia has been the location and the focus of dynamic, important feminist scholarship and activism. In this collection of essays, prominent feminist scholars and activists build on that work to confront pressing new challenges for feminist theorizing and practice. Examining recent feminist interventions in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, they address feminist responses to religious fundamentalism and secularism; globalization, labor, and migration; militarization and state repression; public representations of sexuality; and the politics of sex work. Their essays attest to the diversity and specificity of South Asian locations and feminist concerns, while also demonstrating how feminist engagements in the region can enrich and advance feminist theorizing globally. ,Contributors,.

Blurb: For over a generation, shocking cases of censorship at Americas colleges and universities have taught students the wrong lessons about living in a free society. Drawing on a decade of experience battling for freedom of speech on campus, First Amendment lawyer Greg Lukianoff reveals how higher education fails to teach its students to become critical thinkers by supercharging ideological divisions, promoting groupthink, and encouraging an unscholarly certainty about complex issues.,Lukianoff walks readers through the life of a modern-day college student, from orientation to the end of freshman year. Through this lens, he describes startling violations of free speech rights: a student in Indiana punished for publicly reading a book, a student in Georgia expelled for a pro-environment collage he posted on Facebook, students at Yale banned from putting an F. Scott Fitzgerald quote on a t-shirt, and students across the country banished to tiny free speech zones. But Lukianoff goes further, demonstrating how this culture of censorship is bleeding into the larger society. As he explores public controversies involving Juan Williams, Rush Limbaugh, Bill Maher, Richard Dawkins, and Larry Summers, along with campus uproars in which Dave Barry and Jon Stewart's ,The Daily Show, played a role, Lukianoff paints a stark picture of our ability as a nation to rationally discuss important issues. ,Unlearning Liberty: Campus Censorship and the End of American Debate, reveals how the intolerance for dissent and debate on todays campus threatens the freedom of every citizenand makes us all just a little bit dumber.

Blurb: A bare-knuckled, tell-all memoir from Mike Tyson, the onetime heavyweight champion of the worldand a legend both in and out of the ring., , Philosopher, Broadway headliner, fighter, felonMike Tyson has defied stereotypes, expectations, and a lot of conventional wisdom during his three decades in the public eye. Bullied as a boy in the toughest, poorest neighborhood in Brooklyn, Tyson grew up to become one of the most thrilling and ferocious boxers of all timeand the youngest heavyweight champion ever. But his brilliance in the ring was often compromised by reckless behavior. Years of hard partying, violent fights, and criminal proceedings took their toll: by 2003, Tyson had hit rock bottom, a convicted felon, completely broke, the punch line to a thousand bad late-night jokes. Yet he fought his way back; the man who once admitted being addicted to everything regained his success, his dignity, and the love of his family. With a triumphant one-man stage show, his unforgettable performances in the ,Hangover ,films, and his newfound happiness and stability as a father and husband, Tysons story is an inspiring American original., Brutally honest, raw, and often hilarious, Tyson chronicles his tumultuous highs and lows in the same sincere, straightforward manner we have come to expect from this legendary athlete. A singular journey from Brooklyns ghettos to worldwide fame to notoriety, and, finally, to a tranquil wisdom, ,Undisputed Truth ,is not only a great sports memoir but an autobiography for the ages.

She talks her way in. She tells nothing but lies.

Son Magnus, age seventeen, thinks shes an angel.,As Amber insinuates herself into the family, the questions of who she is and how shes come to be there drop away. Instead, dazzled by her seeming exoticism, the Smarts begin to examine the accidents of their lives through the searing lens of Ambers perceptions. When Eve finally banishes her from the cottage, Amber disappears from their sight, but notthey discover when they return home to Londonfrom their profoundly altered lives.,Fearlessly intelligent and written with an irresistible blend of lyricism and whimsy, ,The Accidental, is a tour de force of literary improvisation that explores the nature of truth, the role of chance, and the transformative power of storytelling.

Blurb: Russian Textiles, showcases the gorgeous printed-cotton textiles created and manufactured in Russia and exported to Central Asia from approximately 1860 to 1960. More than 175 spectacular patterns spanning a variety of periods and styles, from Art Nouveau florals to Soviet-era agitprop, are featured. The people in these Central Asian countriesincluding Uzbeks, Tadjiks, and Turkmenincorporated the brightly patterned material into their clothing, particularly their robes, and in their household items. ,Brief essays by the author and fellow textile experts describe the social life of the fabrics and the fascinating history of this merging of Russian, Western, and Central Asian aesthetic styles; Robert Kushner contributes a lively text on how an artist sees and is inspired by these designs. Complementing the pattern images are vintage photographs from the turn of the 20th century as well as beautifully detailed reproductions of the robes and other articles that were lined and embellished with these cloths. ,This is a must-have book for the inspiration library of every artist; professional fashion, interior, and product designer; crafter; and anyone with a love of extraordinary visual design.  Seldom does a new textile book invite one to view its subject matter in an entirely new light, from an entirely new perspective. ,Russian Textiles, does just this. These cloths, with their boldly printed designs, are generally considered to be of little importance, and have been viewed with little contextual foundation. ,Russian Textiles: Printed Cloth for the Bazaars of, ,Central Asia,, changes this landscape and presents a collage of information and startling visuals. It fills a niche in our knowledge and appreciation of the dynamics of the textile trade in Central Asia, a niche that most of us were hardly aware was empty and needed to be addressed. Such is the groundbreaking nature of this book. - - Thomas Cole, ,HALI Magazine,, ,Spring 2008, ,,Mellers book is a voyage of discoverya joyous celebration of pattern and colour, and of a way of life in Central Asia - - Brigid Keenan ,STEPPE Magazine,, ,Summer 2008,,The intriguing title with its mingling of the commonplace and the exotic, neatly sums up the esoteric collecting field that fascinates Meller and sets her apart from the typical high-end textile hunter who is searching for silken ikats or woven carpets. According to Mellers view, machine-printed textiles qualify as fine art that happens to be for a commercial product.  Andrea DiNoto, ,American Craft Magazine,, ,Oct/Nov 2008,,,Russian Textiles, is one of those rare and serendipitous books that can be judged by its cover.

Blurb: A noted clinical epidemiologist shows how evidence-based medicine can help us understand and assess news about health risks, cures, and treatment breakthroughs, The press and other media constantly report news stories about dangerous chemicals in the environment, miracle cures, the safety of therapeutic treatments, and potential cancer-causing agents. But what exactly is actually meant by increased riskshould we worry if we are told that we are at twice the risk of developing an illness? And how do we interpret reduced risk to properly assess the benefits of noisily touted dietary supplements?Demonstrating the difficulty of separating the hype from the hypothesis, noted epidemiologist Michael Bracken clearly communicates how clinical epidemiology works. Using everyday terms, Bracken describes how professional scientists approach questions of disease causation and therapeutic efficacy to provide readers with the tools to help them understand whether warnings of environmental risk are truly warranted, or if claims of therapeutic benefit are justified.

Blurb: Actress Dyan Cannon's relationship with film legend Cary Grant was short, tumultuous, and, by every description, odd. When they began living together, she was 25; he was 58. Three years later, they married, but within a year and a half, she left him, amidst reports of loud arguments and spanking episodes. Their divorce, finalized in 1968, was a major news splash even in that pre-TMZ, pre-internet era. Grant died in 1986, but Cannon has continued to wrestle with the details, the rights, and the wrongs of their relationship. Dear Cary is a memoir that celebrates and scrutinizes the great love of her life.

Blurb: From Africa-inspired to African-made, this guide is the first to celebrate a new wave of fashion designers who are emerging on the global stage. Ever since the late 1960s when Yves Saint Laurent and Paco Rabanne presented African-inspired collections, the textiles, details, and colors of Africa have moved into the realm of high fashion. In the past few years, young designers from the continent itself have emerged as people to watch in the fashion world. Helen Jennings, editor of award-winning ARISE magazine, offers in this book a brief history of African fashion, beauty and style, follows its influence on modern designers, and spotlights the best designers, photographers, and models from across the continent and the African diaspora. Profiling popular lines such as Duro Olowu, Jewel by Lisa, Black Coffee, and Eric Raisina, Jennings explores the myriad reasons why African fashion is having its moment in the sun. She shows show designers are looking beyond cliches of the African aesthetic by embracing both traditional and contemporary fabrics and garments, and how the passion for ethically and environmentally conscious clothing is fueling this trend. As colorful and exciting as the fashions it features, this volume will appeal to anyone interested in following the world's most exciting new fashion development.

Blurb: An insider's look at the science of near-Earth comets and asteroids,Of all the natural disasters that could befall us, only an Earth impact by a large comet or asteroid has the potential to end civilization in a single blow. Yet these near-Earth objects also offer tantalizing clues to our solar system's origins, and someday could even serve as stepping-stones for space exploration. In this book, Donald Yeomans introduces readers to the science of near-Earth objects--its history, applications, and ongoing quest to find near-Earth objects before they find us.,In its course around the sun, the Earth passes through a veritable shooting gallery of millions of nearby comets and asteroids. One such asteroid is thought to have plunged into our planet sixty-five million years ago, triggering a global catastrophe that killed off the dinosaurs. Yeomans provides an up-to-date and accessible guide for understanding the threats posed by near-Earth objects, and also explains how early collisions with them delivered the ingredients that made life on Earth possible. He shows how later impacts spurred evolution, allowing only the most adaptable species to thrive--in fact, we humans may owe our very existence to objects that struck our planet.,Yeomans takes readers behind the scenes of today's efforts to find, track, and study near-Earth objects. He shows how the same comets and asteroids most likely to collide with us could also be mined for precious natural resources like water and oxygen, and used as watering holes and fueling stations for expeditions to Mars and the outermost reaches of our solar system.

Blurb: This collection examines how useful research can be achieved and argues that in order to keep organizational research relevant to theory and practice, the approach must deviate from the orthodoxy of positivistic, pure research approaches. The contributing authors were selected for their demonstrated ability to conduct useful research, and they bring their unique professional experience to their chapters by describing the choices they make and the tactics they employ.,,The core message of this book is that in order to conduct research that is useful, researchers must learn from practice and intentionally position their work so that it finds a pathway to practice. While each chapter can stand alone, the book is crafted to provide multiple complementary perspectives on the topic of useful research. It does an outstanding job of describing what it takes to bridge the gap between theory and practice. It goes beyond advocacy, theoretical debate, and restatements of the problem to focus on the types of research methods that produce useful research. Topics include crafting research programs to yield useful knowledge, academic careers that yield useful knowledge, pathways to practice, institutional agents such as MBA programs and journals.

Blurb: '...And then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, it was dead men that we reaped.' Harriet Tubman,In five years, Jesmyn Ward lost five men in her life, to drugs, accidents, suicide, and the bad luck that can follow people who live in poverty, particularly black men. Dealing with these losses, one after another, made Jesmyn ask the question: why? And as she began to write about the experience of living through all the dying, she realized the truth--and it took her breath away. Her brother and her friends all died because of who they were and where they were from, because they lived with a history of racism and economic struggle that fostered drug addiction and the dissolution of family and relationships. Jesmyn says the answer was so obvious she felt stupid for not seeing it. But it nagged at her until she knew she had to write about her community, to write their stories and her own. ,Jesmyn grew up in poverty in rural Mississippi. She writes powerfully about the pressures this brings, on the men who can do no right and the women who stand in for family in a society where the men are often absent. She bravely tells her story, revisiting the agonizing losses of her only brother and her friends. As the sole member of her family to leave home and pursue high education, she writes about this parallel American universe with the objectivity distance provides and the intimacy of utter familiarity.

Blurb: In this refreshingly revisionist history, Erik Reinert shows how rich countries developed through a combination of government intervention, protectionism, and strategic investment, rather than through free trade. Reinert suggests that this set of policies in various combinations has driven successful development from Renaissance Italy to the modern Far East. Yet despite its demonstrable sucess, orthodox developemt economists have largely ignored this approach and insisted instead on the importance of free trade. Reinart shows how the history of economics has long been torn between the continental Renaissance tradition on one hand and the free market theories of English and later American economies on the other. Our economies were founded on protectionism and state activismlook at China todayand could only later afford the luxury of free trade. When our leaders come to lecture poor countries on the right road to riches they do so in almost perfect ignorance of the real history of national affluence.

Blurb: Ravi Zacharias was born in India and has literally moved from the East to the West and the West to the East and repeated the cycle again and again to answer skeptics questions about whether God is alive, who Jesus is, what is truth, and whether we can really find absolutes. Ravi has spoken of his own journey only in bits and pieces in his other books and talks. It is a journey that has led him beyond his family and culture into a revelation that replaced pantheism with monotheism, and into a relationship with a God the vast majority of his people do not worship. From this new understanding birthed in him by the founder of Christianity, Ravi has gone forward to teach as one of our generations great apologists.,A life lived in Christ is the greatest argument of all for the living God. Ravi urges the reader to look at the lives that have turned the hearts of people into movements for Christ. In the first three centuries of the church, the Apostles and followers like Polycarp and Tertullian and Origen demonstrated with their lives the truth of the resurrected Christ. A whole line of witnesses from every generation succeeded these who walked in the footsteps of Jesus, with names like Augustine, Catherine of Sienna, Bernard of Clairvaux, Luther, and Wesley leading the procession.,But history begins on an individual level.,Ravi shows readers his life, in its successes and failures, in its existence in the East and in the West, and in his attempts to bring the truth of Christ to those in any culture who dont know him. The Hebrew poet has said that a life rich in experiences is a life from which others can learn.,This book is about Ravis journey, from meaninglessness to the abundant joy of Christ, from East to West and back again, in the all-consuming passion of letting the world know about true freedom, and in whom that freedom is found.

Blurb: This classic book is essential reading for all those interested in the development of modern physics. Sir Arthur Eddington's account of the general theory of relativity, 'without, ' as he says in his preface, 'introducing anything very technical in the way of mathematics, physics or philosophy', was first published in the exciting days of 1920 soon after the first objective tests of the theory had demonstrated its validity. The book was at once received with acclamation by reviewers and remains today one of the simplest and most straightforward accounts in print. The reviewer in the Athenaeum described it as 'a masterly book. The arrangement, the vigour and ease of the reasoning, the felicity of illustration, the clear, flexible prose and (we must mention it) the wit, make this book one of the most adequate and engaging attempts at the non-technical exposition of a scientific theory that it has ever been our good fortune to encounter.' This reissue includes a foreword by Sir Hermann Bondi, FRS, giving a brief appraisal of the book, and placing it in its historical and scientific context

Blurb: Quand on pensait avoir termin la srie sur une note assez moyenne, lauteur revient en grande pompe avec, disons le, les petits prfrs de sans doute beaucoup de lecteurs. Yuki et son voyou de voisin sont particulirement attendrissants dans ce cinquime tome inattendu. Mme aprs avoir franchi une tape importante de leur relation, Yukimura et Shinonome sont au point mort, lun tant trop distant pour lautre, le second se faisant trop prsent. Seulement, un semblant de personnage trange voulant apparemment du mal au vice prsident va permettre aux deux jeunes gens de se retrouver sans rellement le vouloir, de se comprendre au-del des malentendus et de saccepter sans tenir compte des premires impressions. Ainsi, ce volume 5 sattarde beaucoup sur la relation charnelle qui sest dj installe par le pass, mais aborde avec talent les motions des deux protagonistes. Il nest en effet pas superflu de montrer laspect mignon de Yuki, lattention et le dsir de son compagnon  Le manga se fait  la fois sensuel et romantique, avec de nombreux moments attendrissants. Un bonus leur est mme consacr, comme tout le tome. Il est agrable de retrouver Yuki et Shinonome au centre de toutes les attentions de lauteur ,Ce couple, bien plus raliste et moins strotyp que le prcdent, fera sans doute beaucoup dadeptes en reprenant les codes du yaoi, qui associent avec dlicatesse la douceur et le concept du  mignon  avec les scnes parfois trs crues. Ainsi, les deux notions se mlangent parfaitement dans ces quelques pages qui, si elles sont parfois un peu tires par les cheveux avec ce mystrieux agresseur, rvlent bien des trsors de sentiments. Voir un Yukimura saplatir et sabaisser  attendre Shinonome pour aller en cours, le suivre sur la voie du plaisir  Une focalisation presque totale sur Yukimura et ses hsitations et autres rticences, tandis que son compagnon est trait plus lgrement mais avec quand mme de grands moments particulirement intressants par ses interventions  Lauteur ne parvient pas  lasser, et si lon sait rellement les deux jeunes gens lancs, on attend maintenant avec impatience le prochain tome qui mettra trs certainement en scne les deux frres de Mikado et Towa  Que dhomosexualit, plus ou moins bien traite !

Blurb: James Levine, the legendary conductor and artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera, is one of the most public and yet most private figures in classical music. In his more than 25 years as maestro of the Met, Levine has carried his musical message around the world. His appearances in the opera houses and concert halls of Europe and Japan have been greeted with a fervor that not only matches but sometimes exceeds the loyalty and adoration of his fans in America. In "Dialogues and Discoveries, " eminent music critic Robert C. Marsh presents the man behind the musical triumphs. From a series of interviews and conversations conducted over a period of 25 years with the maestro, his family, his colleagues, and his friends, Marsh brings us the private, the personal James Levine. Levine's musical gifts were recognized early and fostered by his loving and understanding family in Ohio. Both parents had had professional careers -- his father was a musician, his mother an actress -- and they indulged and encouraged their prodigiously talented son, whether he was memorizing opera scores during elementary school recesses or designing productions with a toy theater. By the time he was in his teens, Levine was working with the remarkable George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, where he made his debut at the age of 23. Four years later, he was at the Metropolitan Opera and also served as the director of the Ravinia Festival, the summer home of the Chicago Symphony, for 23 seasons. Today he is truly, as "New York" magazine has said, 'the Met's most valuable player.' Under his guidance, the opera house has become the premier operatic stage in the world and the Metropolitan Orchestra one of the finestensembles. In Europe, he has been a regular conductor at the Wagnerian shrine, Bayreuth; the Salzburg Festival; and in Vienna and Berlin. In addition, he appears regularly on television and will conduct 'Fantasia 2000, ' the long-awaited sequel to the Disney classic 'Fantasia.' Robert Marsh has covered Levine in the concert hall, the recording studio, the opera house, and arenas and stadiums for the blockbuster Three Tenors concerts. He has produced a fascinating look at the world of classical music. Levine has known and worked with the famous musical figures of the past 25 years, and they all appear in "Dialogues and Discoveries" -- sopranos and basses, violinists and pianists, tenors and baritones. One voice is dominant throughout, however -- that of James Levine. Here are Levine's opinions of famous colleagues, conductors, opera houses, and orchestras, as well as his assessments of the state of musical performance and the future of the performing arts. "Dialogues and Discoveries" is both a biography and an autobiography of one of the great musical artists of the 20th century.

Blurb: A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings, brings together the principal writings on religious toleration and freedom of expression by one of the greatest philosophers in the Anglophone tradition: John Locke. The son of Puritans, Locke (16321704) became an Oxford academic, a physician, and, through the patronage of the Earl of Shaftesbury, secretary to the Council of Trade and Plantations and to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina. A colleague of Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton and a member of the English Royal Society, Locke lived and wrote at the dawn of the Enlightenment, a period during which traditional mores, values, and customs were being questioned.,This volume opens with Locke's ,Letter Concerning Toleration, (1689) and also contains his earlier ,Essay Concerning Toleration ,(1667), extracts from the ,Third Letter for Toleration ,(1692), and a large body of his briefer essaysand memoranda on this theme. As editor Mark Goldie writes inthe introduction, ,A Letter Concerning Toleration,"was one of the seventeenth century's most eloquent pleas to Christians to renounce religious persecution." Locke's contention, fleshed out in the ,Essay, and in the ,Third Letter,, that men should enjoy a perfect and "uncontrollable liberty" in matters of religion was shocking to many in seventeenth-century England. Still more shocking, perhaps, was its corollary, that the magistrate had no standing in matters of religion. Taken together, these works forcefully present Locke's belief in the necessary interrelation between limited government and religious freedom. At a time when the world is again having to come to terms with profound tensions among diverse religions and cultures, they are a canonical statement of the case for religious and intellectual freedom.,This Liberty Fund edition provides the first fully annotated modern edition of ,A Letter Concerning Toleration,, offering the reader explanatory guidance to Locke's rich reservoir of references and allusions. The introduction, a chronology of Locke's life, and a reading guide further equip the reader with historical, theological, and philosophical contexts for understanding one of the world's major thinkers on toleration, who lived and wrote at the close of Europe's Reformation and the dawn of the Enlightenment.,This book is the first volume in Liberty Fund's Thomas Hollis Library series. As general editor David Womersley explains, Thomas Hollis (17201774) was a businessman and philanthropist who gathered books he thought were essential to the understanding of liberty and donated them to libraries in Europe and America in the years preceding the American Revolution.,John Locke ,(16321704) was an English philosopher and physician.,Mark Goldie, is Reader in British Intellectual History, University of Cambridge and is co-editor of ,The Cambridge History of Political Thought, 14501700, and editor of ,John Locke: Two Treatises of Government ,and ,John Locke: Political Essays,.,David Womersley, is Thomas Warton Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford.

Blurb: The Idyll of the White Lotus is a story told in all ages, and among every people. It is the tragedy of the soul. Attracted by desire, it stoops to sin; brought to itself by suffering, it turns for help to the redeeming spirit within and in the final sacrifice achieves its apotheosis and sheds a blessing on mankind. It is a story of initiation written in tender and beautiful language, and bears on its face the stamp of verdicity in simplicity and dignity. Behold I stood alone, one among many, an isolated individual in the midst of a united crowd. And I was alone, because, among all the men my brethren who knew, I alone was the man who both knew and taught. I taught the believers at the gate, and was driven to do this by the power that dwelleth in the sanctuary. I had no escape, for in that deep darkness of the most sacred shrine, I beheld the light of the inner life, and was driven to reveal it, and by it was I upheld and made strong. For indeed, although I died, it took ten priests of the temple to accomplish my death, and even then they but ignorantly thought themselves powerful. Mabel Collins was a writer of popular occult novels, a fashion writer and an anti-vivisection campaigner. She was a theosophist and author of over 46 books.

Blurb: Written in the tradition of the vastly popular Prometheus title Atheism: The Case Against God and The Atheist Debater's Handbook, this accessible and inviting primer of nonbelief ponders eight of the most-asked questions about atheism. What is atheism? How can atheists have morals? How can atheists have purpose in their lives? Doesn't the Bible show that god exists? Do reports of miracles prove the existence of a god? Aren't there philosophical proofs demonstrating that god exists? Wouldn't a person have to know everything to say that god doesn't exist? What's wrong with believing on faith? These are the concerns that arise when believers and those who are simply curious question the purpose and meaning they suspect is lacking in the lives of nonbelievers. These questions also come up in philosophical and theological debates on the assumptions and merits of both belief and nonbelief. Krueger contends that atheism is a powerful alternative to the religious outlook so prevalent today, yet it is also one of the most misunderstood because people harbor preconceived ideas about atheism. This concise introduction to atheism, from a scholar who has led thousands of students to the enlightenment of freethought, has been designed with the general audience in mind.

Blurb: The 17th century was a dynamic period characterized by huge political and social changes, including the Civil War, the execution of Charles I, the Commonwealth and the Restoration. The Britain of 1714 was recognizably more modern than it was in 1603. At the heart of these changes was religion and the search for an acceptable religious settlement, which stimulated the Pilgrim Fathers to leave to settle America, the Popish plot and the Glorious Revolution in which James II was kicked off the throne.,This book looks at both the private aspects of human beliefs and practices and also institutional religion, investigating the growing competition between rival versions of Christianity and the growing expectation that individuals should be allowed to worship as they saw fit.

However, on his first day of class, he meets and befriends the mysterious transfer student, Miu Frinji. Driven by his desire to become stronger and to protect those around him, he follows her to Ryzanpaku, a dojo where those who are truly strong and have mastered their arts gather (Ryzanpaku comes from the Chinese story of Heroes of the Water Margin who train together at Liangshan ). After learning basics from Miu, Kenichi is able to beat a high-ranking member of the school's karate club, and becomes a target for all the delinquents in the school. Kenichi's reason for training is to fulfill the promise he made to protect Miu. Subsequently, Kenichi's daily routine is divided between hellish training under the six masters of Ryzanpaku, and his fights against the members of Ragnarok, a gang that views him as either a possible ally or an impending threat to their plans.,After defeating Ragnarok, Kenichi faces a new enemy called Yomi, a group of disciples who are each personally trained by a master of an even bigger organization rivaling Ryzanpaku, Yami. While the masters of Ryzanpaku follow the principle of always sparing their opponents' lives (Katsujin-ken), the members of Yami believe that defeating an opponent is valid by any means including murder (Satsujin-ken). Caught in the struggle between the two factions, Kenichi, Miu and their ever growing team of allies join forces to fight the members of Yomi, while his masters confront the members of Yami in a battle to decide the future of the martial arts' world.

Blurb: One of Americas most distinguished defenders of civil liberties presents measures that will prevent terrorism and still uphold our democratic values, The greatest danger facing the world today, says Alan M. Dershowitz, comes from religiously inspired, state sponsored terrorist groups that seek to develop weapons of mass destruction for use against civilian targets. In his newest book, Dershowitz argues passionately and persuasively that global terrorism is a phenomenon largely of our own making and that we must and can take steps to reduce the frequency and severity of terrorist acts. Analyzing recent acts of terrorism and our reaction to them, Dershowitz explains that terrorism is successful when the international community gives in to the demands of terroristsor even tries to understand and eliminate the root causes of terrorism. He discusses extreme approaches to wiping out international terrorism that would work if we were not constrained by legal, moral, and humanitarian considerations. And then, given that we do operate under such constraints, he offers a series of proposals that would effectively reduce the frequency and severity of international terrorism by striking a balance between security and liberty.

Blurb: Synopsis: Enormous challenges and opportunities face the Christian church in our globalized, rapidly changing world. It is becoming increasingly clear that the church and its leaders need a missional self-understanding. In this volume, Graham Hill asks: "What does it mean for the church to be truly missional?" This book outlines the thought of twelve leading thinkers, and puts their thinking into conversation with a missional understanding of the church. Most of the missional literature of the past twenty years is practical, telling us how to be a missional church, rather than why certain theological themes compel the church toward a missional self-understanding and existence. This book takes a different approach. It outlines a basic missional understanding of the church by engaging theology and Scripture. It examines some of the key theological themes that are foundational for a missional church, and does this in conversation with twelve leading thinkers. This book provides indispensable foundations for a Christ-centered, gospel-shaped, theologically informed, and systematic missional view of the church. Endorsements: "Graham Hill ranges far and wide in order to construct a viable ecumenical, but distinctly missional, ecclesiology. In so doing, he provides us with a classy, intelligent, and passionate contribution to one of the defining issues of our time." --Alan Hirsch Author of The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church "It is increasingly clear to me that Christian understandings of both the nature and the mission of the church are in considerable disarray today. Graham Hill's highly important book offers the beginnings of a profoundly important exploration of both questions, together. Salt, Light, and a City is must reading." --David P. Gushee Mercer University "Graham Hill writes from a Protestant evangelical perspective, but this is a broadly based study, drawing on insights from all the historic traditions as well as biblical understandings and on case studies that highlight the experience of those who are operating on the missional edge today. This is a significant contribution to the ongoing discussions about missiology and ecclesiology that will take the conversation forward in creative and well-informed directions." --John Drane Author of After McDonaldization: Mission, Ministry, and Christian Discipleship in an Age of Uncertainty "Salt, Light, and a City is no cloying attempt at a simplistic universal model for the missional church. Graham Hill insists we do the hard work of engaging Trinitarian theology, contemporary missiology, and broad understandings of ecclesiology to find a way forward. In brief, it is an invaluable addition to any library of research into the missional paradigm." --Michael Frost Morling College (Sydney, Australia Author Biography: Graham Hill is Professor of Leadership and Pastoral Theology at Morling College in Sydney, Australia (affiliated with the MCD University of Divinity). His ministry experiences include church planting, pastoring in a large growing congregation, and coaching pastors and planters of missional experiments.

They may appear to be flesh-and-blood creatures, but is that what they really are?,Redfern sets out to prove that the true nature of the fearsome creatures that dwell in dark and shadowy woods, atop imposing mountainous peaks, and within the depths of murky lakes and rivers can only be understood with a knowledge of ancient rituals designed to conjure up foul life forms from some terrible realm, ominous sacrificial ceremonies undertaken in the dead of night, and disturbing occult rites.,Monsters do exist. Monsters are among us. But they are not what you probably think they are.

Everyone except Emperor Justinian, who orders John, his Lord Chamberlain, tofind her murderer or suffer the consequences.,There is no sign of foul play, but many of the aristocrats at the imperial court had good reason to want Theodora dead.

Could the exiled and much hated former tax collector, John the Cappadocian have played a role? Might Gaius, palace physician, have tampered with Theodoras medication? Pope Vigilius, detained in the capital due to a religious controversy, is not above suspicion. Even Johns friends, the lawyer Anatolius and Felix, captain of the place guards, are acting strangely.,As if seeking a murderer who seems to be a gment of the emperors grief-deranged imagination isnt dif cult enough, John must also grapple with domestic upheavals. His daughter, living on an estate outside the city, is about to give birth, and his aging servant Peter is dying. Will John be able to serve justice, his loved ones, and the emperor?,

Blurb: Linux is being adopted by an increasing number of embedded systems developers, who have been won over by its sophisticated scheduling and networking, its cost-free license, its open development model, and the support offered by rich and powerful programming tools. While there is a great deal of hype surrounding the use of Linux in embedded systems, there is not a lot of practical information. ,Building Embedded Linux Systems, is the first in-depth, hard-core guide to putting together an embedded system based on the Linux kernel. This indispensable book features arcane and previously undocumented procedures for:,Building your own GNU development toolchain Using an efficient embedded development framework Selecting, configuring, building, and installing a target-specific kernel Creating a complete target root filesystem Setting up, manipulating, and using solid-state storage devices Installing and configuring a bootloader for the target Cross-compiling a slew of utilities and packages Debugging your embedded system using a plethora of tools and techniques,Details are provided for various target architectures and hardware configurations, including a thorough review of Linux's support for embedded hardware. All explanations rely on the use of open source and free software packages. By presenting how to build the operating system components from pristine sources and how to find more documentation or help, this book greatly simplifies the task of keeping complete control over one's embedded operating system, whether it be for technical or sound financial reasons.,Author Karim Yaghmour, a well-known designer and speaker who is responsible for the Linux Trace Toolkit, starts by discussing the strengths and weaknesses of Linux as an embedded operating system. Licensing issues are included, followed by a discussion of the basics of building embedded Linux systems. The configuration, setup, and use of over forty different open source and free software packages commonly used in embedded Linux systems are also covered. uClibc, BusyBox, U-Boot, OpenSSH, thttpd, tftp, strace, and gdb are among the packages discussed.

Blurb: No aceptes caramelos de extraos, son cuentos que se refieren al peligro que se corre al traspasar los lmites de lo permitido. Once relatos en torno a historias de padres e hijos, hermanos y parejas en situaciones extremas. Historias en primera persona que ahondan en la subjetividad hasta la ltima partcula de ese individuo que intenta aferrarse a la vida. Todos estos cuentos son relatos crudos en los que no hay juicios morales y estn escritos en esa delgada lnea entre eros y tnatos, la sensualidad y la muerte. El cuerpo en los relatos de Andrea Jeftanovic son siempre un escenario ineludible, ah la normalidad experimenta sus abismos y se viven peligros de todo tipo. La autora cultiva como pocos hoy en da el verdadero erotismo, gracias a su estilo atrevido y elegante que sugiere, suscita, trastoca. Leer estos cuentos es un placer peligroso y marginal.

Blurb: Over a span of eighteen years, Lady Bird Johnson recorded forty-seven oral history interviews with Michael Gillette and his colleagues. These conversations, just released in 2011, form the heart of ,Lady Bird Johnson: An Oral History,, an intimate story of a shy young country girl's transformation into one of America's most effective and admired First Ladies.,Lady Bird Johnson's odyssey is one of personal and intellectual growth, political and financial ambition, and a shared life with Lyndon Baines Johnson, one of the most complicated, volatile, and powerful presidents of the 20th century. The former First Lady recounts how a cautious, conservative young woman succumbed to an ultimatum to marry a man she had known for less than three months, how she ran his congressional office during World War II, and how she transformed a struggling Austin radio station into the foundation of a communications empire. As a keen observer of the Washington scene during the eventful decades from the 1930s through the 1960s, Lady Bird Johnson shares dramatic accounts of pivotal moments in American history. We attend informal dinners at Sam Rayburn's apartment and opulent social events at grand mansions from an earlier age. Her rich verbal portraits bring to life scores of personalities, including First Ladies Edith Bolling Wilson, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Truman, Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Pat Nixon.,An informal, candid narrative by one of America's most admired First Ladies, this volume reveals how instrumental Lady Bird Johnson's support and guidance were at each stage of her husband's political ascent and how she herself emerged as a significant political force.

Blurb: Op 1 januari 1997 kwam er een einde aan het nieuwe-mediatijdperk, ook wel het pre-internet tijdperk genoemd. Dit tijdperk wordt door jongeren, de digital natives, vaak gezien als woest en leeg. Maar niets is minder waar. Vanaf 1967 is er in Nederland een industriesector rond nieuwe media opgebouwd. Dat begon met een verwarrende zoektocht naar technologieen, concepten en markten. Hoe nieuwe media te verkopen en aan wie? Vanaf 1980 begon de commercialisering van online-diensten zoals ASCII-databanken, teletekst, videotex, elektronische berichten en Bulletin Board Systems. In 1985 werd de jonge industriesector geconfronteerd met weer een nieuwe technologie, de CD-media, die het broze groeipatroon van de online-diensten dreigde te verstoren. Uiteindelijk kwamen er door de CD-media naast het assortiment aan online-diensten ook off-line producten bij, zoals elektronische boeken en multimediale CD-ROM"s en CD-is. De industriesector rond nieuwe media groeide en professionaliseerde. Terwijl de sector zich opmaakte om een grootschalige videotexdienst in de markt te zetten, sloop internet geruisloos Nederland binnen via de academische wereld. In 1992 waren er nog geen 300 bedrijven aangesloten op internet en acties op de consumentenmarkt leverde niet direct veel nieuwe klanten op. Maar toen op 15 januari 1994 De Digitale Stad haar deuren opende, begeleid door voorlichting door de omroep VPRO, was er geen houden meer aan.In minder dan drie jaar, tussen 1994 en 1997, wist internet in Nederland het aantal abonnees meer dan te verdubbelen, vergeleken met de online-abonnees van videotex. Op 1 januari 1997 werd de omslag naar internet definitief. De dienst Videotex Nederland verdween geruisloos. De internetdienst World Access en de elektronische berichtendienst Memocom werden samengevoegd met Planet Internet. Het was het begin van de grote opmars van internet in Nederland en het was tevens het einde van de nieuwe media in Nederland. Het tijdperk van de digitale media was begonnen.

Blurb: To be a rabble-rouser for peace may seem to be a contradiction in terms. And yet it is the perfect description for Desmond Tutu, Nobel laureate and spiritual father of a democratic South Africa. Tutu understood that justice -- a genuine regard for human rights -- is the only real foundation for peace. And so he stirred up trouble, courageously engaging in heated face-to-face confrontations with South Africa's leaders; he stirred up trouble in the streets, leading peaceful demonstrations amid the barely controlled fury of police battalions; he stirred up trouble on the world stage, seeking international disinvestment in the apartheid economy.Tutu has led one of the great lives of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, and to read his story in full is to be reminded of the power of one inspired man to change history. In this authorized biography, written by John Allen, a distinguished journalist and longtime associate of Tutu, we are witnesses to courage, stirring oratory, and a demonstration of the power of faith to transform the seemingly intransigent.,We know in retrospect that the apartheid resistance movement was successful and that South Africa, though not without its problems, today faces an infinitely brighter future than it might if it had not been for the efforts of Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela, and other leaders.,But no such outcome was ever a certainty. Through the author's personal experiences, total access to the Tutu family and their papers, and considerable research, including the use of new archival material, Allen tells the story of a barefoot schoolboy from a deprived black township who became an international symbol of the democratic spirit and of religious faith.,Allen personally observed how Tutu, at genuine risk to his own safety, repeatedly intervened between armed soldiers and stone-throwing students to keep the peace, how he faced constant death threats and angrily stood up to the leaders of the cruel apartheid system. Using his own faith as a cudgel, Tutu asked those officials to confront their own Christian background and made them reconcile their actions with their own professions of belief.,Often through the sheer power of moral example and with a lyrical command of the English language, Tutu was able to appeal to the conscience of the world and to the emotions of an angry crowd in the streets. And then, when the battle for South African rights was finally won, it was Tutu who insisted on finding a path to forgive the former oppressors by strongly backing and serving on the unprecedented Truth and Reconciliation Commission.,Today, the archbishop continues to appeal to the world's conscience by opposing the continuance of war and the inadequacy of the international response to the AIDS/HIV crisis sweeping Africa. He has led a life of commitment, one that continues to matter.,John Allen has movingly captured the flavor and details of that life and marshaled them into a commanding story, one that sheds light on the struggles and triumphs of our times.

Blurb: Today's National Basketball Association commands millions of spectators worldwide, and its many franchises are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But the league wasn't always so successful or glamorous: in the 1940s and 1950s, the NBA and its predecessor, the Basketball Association of America, were scrambling to attract fans. Teams frequently played in dingy gymnasiums, players traveled as best they could, and their paychecks could bounce higher than a basketball. How did the NBA evolve from an obscure organization facing financial losses to a successful fledgling sports enterprise by 1960?,,Drawing on information from numerous archives, newspaper and periodical articles, and Congressional hearings, ,The Rise of the National Basketball Association, chronicles the league's growing pains from 1946 to 1961. David George Surdam describes how a handful of ambitious ice hockey arena owners created the league as a way to increase the use of their facilities, growing the organization by fits and starts. Rigorously analyzing financial data and league records, Surdam points to the innovations that helped the NBA thrive: regular experiments with rules changes to make the game more attractive to fans, and the emergence of televised sports coverage as a way of capturing a larger audience. Notably, the NBA integrated in 1950, opening the game to players who would dominate the game by the end of the 1950sdecade: Bill Russell, Elgin Baylor, Wilt Chamberlain, and Oscar Robertson. Long a game that players loved to play, basketball became a professional sport well supported by community leaders, business vendors, and an ever-growing number of fans.

Blurb: First published in 1952 and immediately hailed as a masterpiece, ,Invisible Man, is one of those rare novels that have changed the shape of American literature. For not only does Ralph Ellison's nightmare journey across the racial divide tell unparalleled truths about the nature of bigotry and its effects on the minds of both victims and perpetrators, it gives us an entirely new model of what a novel can be.,As he journeys from the Deep South to the streets and basements of Harlem, from a horrifying "battle royal" where black men are reduced to fighting animals, to a Communist rally where they are elevated to the status of trophies, Ralph Ellison's nameless protagonist ushers readers into a parallel universe that throws our own into harsh and even hilarious relief. Suspenseful and sardonic, narrated in a voice that takes in the symphonic range of the American language, black and white, ,Invisible Man, is one of the most audacious and dazzling novels of our century.

Blurb: Life at Bungay Castle seems ideal for the De Morney family. Nestled in the abundant countryside of Norfolk, Bungay Castle's massive towers reach for blue skies and its solid stone walls are firmly planted in the earth - but all that's about to change. Strong winds from a violent storm bring the sound of chilling, ghostly cries located far below the castle's floors. The young De Morneys, Roseline and Edwin, begin a frightening search through the ancient subterranean passageways to discover the cause. Among the dark haunted dungeons, they discover a secret from their family's past that will forever change their lives. Cob-webbed passageways lit by a single candle, rotting caskets, ghostly sightings, and a mysterious mournful cry are just a few of the abundant gothic surprises in store for all who dare to wonder beyond the castle's locked doors. Firmly rooted in the Domestic Gothic tradition, Elizabeth Bonhote's rediscovered 1796 classic is a treasure chest of gothic elements. Combining romance, mystery, seduction, and betrayal, Bungay Castle revises and reinvents the tradition of the trapped female heroine. As we follow Roseline's journey, we become aware of one of the novel's most unique aspects: it is a surprisingly feminist novel- a rare achievement in the eighteenth century gothic genre. Rather than waiting to be rescued by men, the young women of Bungay castle achieve agency over their lives, refuse patriarchal orders, and become the rescuing heroines. An exemplary blend of sentiment, romance and the gothic, this reprint is a welcome and long overdue addition to the bookshelves of academics, subway riders, goths, and anyone longing to rediscover the joy of a great read.

Blurb:  Set in the remote Kootenay Valley in western Canada, Once You Break a Knuckle tells stories of good people doing bad things: two bullied adolescents sabotage a rope swing, resulting in another boys death; a heartbroken young man refuses to warn his best friend about an approaching car; sons challenge fathers and break taboos. Crackling with tension and propelled by jagged, cutting dialogue, the stories interconnect and reveal to us how our best intentions are doomed to fail or injure, how our loves can fall short or mislead us, how even friendshipespecially friendshipcan be something dangerously temporary.,Wilsons world is always dangerous, barbed with violence and the possibility of betrayal. And yet, in this small, finely-wrought universe, a dogged, wry dignity is usually enough to see us through.,An intoxicating alloy of adrenaline and the kind of vulnerability we would all admit to if we were honest, Once You Break a Knuckle is about the courage it takes just to make it through the day.

Blurb: A cultural phenomenon in his dayan award-winning film director and actor who also wrote novels, plays, and movie scriptsVasily Shukshin (19291974) is renowned for his mastery of the short story. Credited with revitalizing the short story as a genre in Russian literature, he was posthumously honored with the Soviet Union's highest literary prize following his untimely death at the age of forty-five. ,Stories from a Siberian Village, introduces Shukshin to English readers with twenty-five stories that reflect the Siberian origins of his artistic identity. These stories, most of which have never before appeared in English, are set in a remote Siberian village caught in transition between rural traditions and modern Soviet life. There Shukshin's peasantssurvivors of revolution, collectivization, and warseek their identity in a "brave new world." ,Eccentrics and oddballs, Shukshin's protagonists are restless freedom seekers whose dreams and foibles are as broad and inexplicable as their native Siberian landscape. As touchy as artists and as unpretentious as truck drivers, they struggle with questions of life and death, faith and reason, custom and progress. From their mutual misapprehensions and the gap between their dreams and reality arises Shukshin's biting humor.

Blurb: In ,Old World Witchcraft,, noted author Raven Grimassi covers totally new territoryin his work and in the world of popular witchcraft books published in the last few decades. This book is actually about "an enchanted worldview," one that has not necessarily been inherited from the beliefs and practices of any particular region and one which is available to us today.,The "Old World" in the title is actually about a magical view of the Plant Kingdom and the spirits attached to it. While Grimassi's previous books discuss the cultural expressions and commonality of witchcraft beliefs and practices in general, this book penetrates much deeper.,Old World Witchdraft, reveals rarely discussed topics such as the concept of Shadow as the organic memory of the earth. Readers will learn rooted techniques that possess power because these ways have always been connected to it. They will learn methods of interfacing with the ancestral current and with the organic memory of the earth. Through these they can connect with the timeless arts and learn methods of empowerment directly from the ancient source.,Totally new information about familiar tools is presented. For example, the mortar and pestle is a tool for spell casting, a device that creates interfacing with plant spirits and with shadow, and a focal point for veneration of the Plant Kingdom. Grimassi also presents the art of using plant ashes for magical sigil work.,This book is for people who have had their fill of books that say the same things over and over, who want to take the next step, and who are eager for the more rooted ways that have remained largely hidden.

Blurb: For hundreds of years the fishermen of the British Isles have gone to the sea wearing Guernsey and Jersey sweaters. Among landlubbers as well, these sweaters are perennially popular, but, especially in this country, it is often hard to find practical instructions for the patterns that are traditional in Britain. Here is a book that presents fully 82 different genuine folk patterns for both the lighter weight Jerseys and the heavierGuernseys, and diagrams many more patterns that you can use in your knitting. ,The author gives the names of the stitches and patterns traditionally used in making Jerseys and Guernseys, and she tells you exactly how to knit every sweater in this book using those patterns and stitches. Here you will find patterns taken from sweaters found in Yorkshire, Norfolk, the west coast of Ireland, the Scottish Hebrides, and the Aran Islands. These are sweaters that have often been handed down from father to son for several generations, they wear so well. Instructions for these sturdy sweaters are given row by row for knitting fronts, backs, sleeves, and necks, in the traditional fashion. Each set of instructions is accompanied by a diagram of the pattern and, often, by a photograph of the finished sweater. All of these sweaters can be worn by either men or women, but the author has also provided full directions for making two sets of sweaters and cardigans expressly adapted for ladies' wear. Mrs. Thompson also includes interesting information about the people who gave her the patterns for this book.

Blurb: This title is printed in full color throughout.,From one of the most original and influential neuroscientists at work today, here is an exploration of consciousness unlike any otheras told by Galileo, who opened the way for the objectivity of science and is now intent on making subjective experience a part of science as well.,,Galileos journey has three parts, each with a different guide. In the first, accompanied by a scientist who resembles Francis Crick, he learns why certain parts of the brain are important and not others, and why consciousness fades with sleep. In the second part, when his companion seems to be named Alturi (Galileo is hard of hearing; his companions name is actually Alan Turing), he sees how the facts assembled in the first part can be unified and understood through a scientific theorya theory that links consciousness to the notion of integrated information (also known as phi). In the third part, accompanied by a bearded man who can only be Charles Darwin, he meditates on how consciousness is an evolving, developing, ever-deepening awareness of ourselves in history and culturethat it is everything we have and everything we are.,,Not since ,Gdel, Escher, Bach, has there been a book that interweaves science, art, and the imagination with such originality. This beautiful and arresting narrative will transform the way we think of ourselves and the world.

Blurb: It is often agreed that militarism, the aggressive policy of arming nations, was a chief cause of the wars of the twentieth century between forces loyal to Germany and those loyal to Britain. , ,In a very comprehensive study across 150 years, Colonel T. N. Dupuy uses his experience in the US Army to explain the manoeuvrings and characters behind German warfare in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is the General Staff who influence the performance of the Army, institutionalising military excellence in direct and indirect ways. , ,Colonel Dupuy begins with the Prussian generals of the 1800s including Frederick the Great, and then tells of the alliance between Prussia and Germany in the aftermath of the German victory in the Franco-Prussian War. , ,Colonel Dupuy goes on to write excellently about the two generals named Moltke, uncle and nephew, who steered the German army from the nineteenth to the twentieth centuries. , ,He extols the military virtues of the man whose idea it was to invade France by using the neutrality of Belgium, von Schlieffen, whose plan seemed so brilliant before Britain saw through it during World War I. , ,Following the Treaty of Versailles, which led to the resignations of Groener and the ascendancy of Hindenburg to President, Germany was saved from dissolution and civil war by the brilliant Seeckt. , ,The rise of the National Socialist party, headed by the charismatic Adolf Hitler, made rearmament a pillar of their policies. The story ends with the offensives of World War II and the lessons historians and military strategists can learn from them. , ,This book is a detailed study of the goings-on in the committee rooms and at the frontline of the nation which had in modern times a genius for war. , ,Praise for Trevor Dupuy: , ,Superb...enthralling...highly recommended.  Library Journal , ,Concise, well-written...a wide selection of paintings and photographs and excellent maps...aid in understanding the complexities of strategy and following the action.  The New York Times , ,Colonel T. N. Dupuy (1916-1995) commanded American forces during World War II, serving in Burma and China, before becoming a professor and military historian at Harvard University and then on to Ohio State University. Together with his father, he wrote the textbook Military Heritage of America which has for half a century been used widely as a teaching aid. His other books include Brave Men and Great Captains and a series of Military Lives which focussed on great war leaders from Alexander the Great to Winston Churchill. He pioneered the Quantified Judgment Method of Analysis to use the lessons of past combat for today, established the Dupuy Institute for that very purpose, and often appeared on television as a pundit, giving his opinion on contemporary combats. , ,Endeavour Press is the UK's leading independent digital publisher.

Blurb: Until two centuries ago the emotions did not exist. Thomas Dixon reveals in this study how emotions came into being as a distinct psychological category. They replaced such concepts as appetites, passions, sentiments and affections, which had preoccupied thinkers as diverse as Augustine, Aquinas, Hume, and Darwin. The book is a significant original contribution to the debate which has preoccupied western thinkers across many disciplines in recent decades.

Blurb: Perhaps the best known of Msgr. Benson s works, this novel has been reprinted many times since its publication in 1912. The drama and the characters therein have their basis in the real life account of a Catholic family, and of the sufferings of Catholics in general, under Elizabeth I of England. In this story of deep tragedy and terror Msgr. Benson portrays the conflict between natural, tender human passion and divine love, and its heroic resolution worked out in the hearts of the two principal characters, along with the development of the doctrine of vocation.

Blurb: The Story of Mexico's political rebirth, by two pulitzer prize-winning reporters,Opening Mexico, is a narrative history of the citizens' movement which dismantled the kleptocratic one-party state that dominated Mexico in the twentieth century, and replaced it with a lively democracy. Told through the stories of Mexicans who helped make the transformation, the book gives new and gripping behind-the-scenes accounts of major episodes in Mexico's recent politics.,Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, led by presidents who ruled like Mesoamerican monarchs, came to be called "the perfect dictatorship." But a 1968 massacre of student protesters by government snipers ignited the desire for democratic change in a generation of Mexicans. ,Opening Mexico, recounts the democratic revolution that unfolded over the following three decades. It portrays clean-vote crusaders, labor organizers, human rights monitors, investigative journalists, Indian guerrillas, and dissident political leaders, such as President Ernesto Zedillo-Mexico's Gorbachev. It traces the rise of Vicente Fox, who toppled the authoritarian system in a peaceful election in July 2000.,Opening Mexcio, dramatizes how Mexican politics works in smoke-filled rooms, and profiles many leaders of the country's elite. It is the best book to date about the modern history of the United States' southern neighbor-and is a tale rich in implications for the spread of democracy worldwide.

Blurb: Since the first waves of Eastern philosophy traveled across the sea, Westerners have been intrigued by ancient traditions such as tantra, yoga, tai chi, and martial arts. Yet although some aspects of Taoist sexual practices have appeared in print, until now there has been no comprehensive book on Taoist sexual meditation. ,The Water method of Taoist sexual meditation, as was taught by Lao Tse, author of the ,Tao de Ching,, shows us how to use dissolving meditation to relax and let go. This foundation practice ultimately gets us out of our head and into our body and the universe. Sex expands into the world of spirit, enabling us to resolve and clear energetic, emotional, and karmic blockages. With sexual meditation it is possible to access more than four times the energy of solo meditative practices. This abundance of energy can then be directed to healing and to conscious evolution.,You will learn how to work with chi (energy) during sex, gain an understanding of Taoist ethics and morality, and realize the highest spiritual potential of sex as meditation. Find out how to increase sensitivity, activate your yin and yang meridians, and overcome cultural conditioning. Understand how the Chinese theory of the Five Elements can give insight into your own sexual nature and determine sexual compatibility with potential partners.,An accelerated path for internal development, sexual meditation has rarely been shared outside Eastern monasteries. Encouraged by his teachers to bring these authentic practices to the West, Frantzis presents ,Taoist Sexual Meditation, as a profound spiritual path that can heal and calm the turbulence of mind, allowing it to open to the infinite potential of the Tao.

Blurb: In The Courageous State, Richard Murphy argues that neoliberalism has bred weak governments led by weak politicians who believe implicitly in the supremacy of the market. It has created a cowardly state: a state that sees responsibility and then runs away from it. Worse, the weak politicians who run our cowardly state want power solely to ensure that as much tax revenue as possible is used to benefit the private sector that they idolise. But neoliberal theory is wrong - it has created the crises we're suffering. And it has no solution to them. The Courageous State argues powerfully for a new economic model. That model is based on a very different idea of what the role of the state is. The Courageous State is driven by its desire to work on behalf of the people of this country. And that means a Courageous State is populated by politicians who believe in government and in the power of the office they hold. They believe that office exists for the sake of the public good. They know what that public good is. They think it is their job to help each and every person in their country to achieve their potential, sustainably, in a strong mixed economy. And they believe they can command the resources to fulfil this task - whether through tax or other means. A Courageous State offers hope; our existing, cowardly, state does not. Which is why building a Courageous State is essential if we want to both solve our current problems and build a sustainable future. The question is, are you willing to be that Courageous? "Since the 2008 crash conventional economists have run out of ideas. But Richard Murphy abounds with them. He writes with electric clarity about what went wrong and what could be done to put things right. He is a new economic thinker, no mere theoretician but guided by a sharp and practical accountant's eye. He knows where the money is hidden, who has it and how to release it. Murphy is the closest thing to a one-man think tank and he is as courageous as he says our politicians should be." Polly Toynbee, The Guardian newspaper columnist and economics commentator "Rich individuals, corporations, well-funded special interest groups and much of Fleet Street is on one (the wrong) side and then there is Richard Murphy.. . the heroic figure. Tireless and forensic, driven by an admirable moral fervour, I take my hat off to a campaigner with Duracell batteries." Kevin Maguire, Sunday Mirror

Blurb: Widely regarded as the first Singapore novel, ,If We Dream Too Long, explores the dilemmas and challenges faced by its hero, Kwang Meng, as he navigates the difficult transitional period between youthful aspirations and the external demands of society and family. Shy and sensitive, he feels detached from mainstream life and is unable to identify with the values that animate his friends. Kwang Meng takes refuge in dreams of exotic faraway places, and imagines merging himself with the sea, which he loves. Yet amidst this uncertainty, the reader feels that all is not lost, that the young dreamer will eventually find his way. Kwang Meng's experiences reflect the author's fascination with the question of self amidst the dreariness and aimlessness of an increasingly urbanized and materialistic Asian society. This book also provides a fascinating portrait of Singapore as it was in the 1960s, a landscape and society that have undergone many changes but remain faintly visible in modern Singapore.,Since its first publication in 1972, ,If We Dream Too Long, has moved and delighted generations of readers. This much-loved novel has been used as a text in university literature courses in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and has been translated into Tagalog and Russian.

Blurb: Sheila Jeffreys examines the activities of feminist campaigners around such issues as child abuse and prostitution and how these campaigns shaped social purity in the 1880s and 1890s. She demonstrates how the thriving and militant feminism of late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was undermined, and asserts that the decline of this feminism was due largely to the promotion of a sexual ideology which was hostile to womens independence. The circumstances about which she writes are frighteningly familiar in the present political climate.

Blurb: In the early sixteenth century, the monk Filofei proclaimed Moscow the "Third Rome." By the 1930s, intellectuals and artists all over the world thought of Moscow as a mecca of secular enlightenment. In "Moscow, the Fourth Rome," Katerina Clark shows how Soviet officials and intellectuals, in seeking to capture the imagination of leftist and anti-fascist intellectuals throughout the world, sought to establish their capital as the cosmopolitan center of a post-Christian confederation and to rebuild it to become a beacon for the rest of the world.,Clark provides an interpretative cultural history of the city during the crucial 1930s, the decade of the Great Purge. She draws on the work of intellectuals such as Sergei Eisenstein, Sergei Tretiakov, Mikhail Koltsov, and Ilya Ehrenburg to shed light on the singular Zeitgeist of that most Stalinist of periods. In her account, the decade emerges as an important moment in the prehistory of key concepts in literary and cultural studies today-transnationalism, cosmopolitanism, and world literature. By bringing to light neglected antecedents, she provides a new polemical and political context for understanding canonical works of writers such as Brecht, Benjamin, Lukacs, and Bakhtin.,"Moscow, the Fourth Rome "breaches the intellectual iron curtain that has circumscribed cultural histories of Stalinist Russia, by broadening the framework to include considerable interaction with Western intellectuals and trends. Its integration of the understudied international dimension into the interpretation of Soviet culture remedies misunderstandings of the world-historical significance of Moscow under Stalin.

Blurb: The Great Recession is not done with us yet. While the most acute part of the economic crisis is past, the recession's most significant impact on American life still lies in the future. The personal, social, and cultural changes that result from severe economic shocks build and manifest themselves only slowly. But history shows us that, ultimately, shocks this severe profoundly alter the character of society.,,Don Pecks ,Pinched,, a fascinating and harrowing exploration of our dramatic economic climate, keenly observes how the recession has changed the places we live, the work we do, and even who we areand details the transformations that are yet to come. Every class and every generation will be affected: newly minted college graduates, blue-collar men, affluent professionals, exurban families, elite financiers, inner city youth, middle-class retirees. ,,This was not an ordinary recession, and ordinary responses will not fully end it. The crash has shifted the course of the economy. In its aftermath, the middle class is shrinking faster, wealth is becoming more concentrated, twenty-somethings are sinking, and working-class families and communities are changing in unsavory ways.,,We sit today between two eras, buffeted, anxious, and uncertain of the future. Through vivid reporting and lucid argument, Peck helps us make sense of how our society has changed, and why so many people are still struggling. ,,The answers to these questions reveal a new way forward for America. The country has endured periods like this one before, and has emerged all the stronger from them; adaptation and reinvention have been perhaps the nations best and most enduring traits. The time is ripe for another such reinvention. ,Pinched, lays out the principles and public actions that can help us pull it off.

Goblin soon finds himself mixed up in a war between corporate punks and traditional punks that he really couldn't care less about. But without the help of Goblin, Mortician's sperm, and a blue-mohawked female assassin named Shark Girl, the utopian anarchy in Punk Land will surely be lost. Featuring cameos by famous punk icons and cartoonish illustrations in the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut's "Breakfast of Champions."

Forget the postcard-perfect Victoria you think you know; SENSATIONAL VICTORIA explores the capital city's old structures and the not-so saintly spirits that haunt them." ,Seattle Metropolitan Magazine,"SENSATIONAL VICTORIA is an eclectic compendium of truly captivating stories. While a few are sensational because they are about murders and ghosts, most of them are sensational because they excite our senses of sight and sound and allude to our sense of smell. The work of selected artists, writers, poets, and gardeners comes to life through Lazarus's carefully written prose, brief quotations, and excellent photographs." ,BC Studies, "Some of the stories are well known but presented from a different perspective, and the chapter on the Linners brings to light a creative group many may not know.

Blurb: In "To America," Stephen E. Ambrose, one of the country's most influential historians, reflects on his long career as an American historian and explains what an historian's job is all about. He celebrates America's spirit, which has carried us so far. He confronts its failures and struggles. As always in his much acclaimed work, Ambrose brings alive the men and women, famous and not, who have peopled our history and made the United States a model for the world.Taking a few swings at today's political correctness, as well as his own early biases, Ambrose grapples with the country's historic sins of racism, its neglect and ill treatment of Native Americans, and its tragic errors (such as the war in Vietnam, which he ardently opposed on campus, where he was a professor). He reflects on some of the country's early founders who were progressive thinkers while living a contradiction as slaveholders, great men such as Washington and Jefferson. He contemplates the genius of Andrew Jackson's defeat of a vastly superior British force with a ragtag army in the War of 1812. He describes the grueling journey that Lewis and Clark made to open up the country, and the building of the railroad that joined it and produced great riches for a few barons.,Ambrose explains the misunderstood presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, records the country's assumption of world power under the leadership of Theodore Roosevelt, and extols its heroic victory of World War II. He writes about women's rights and civil rights and immigration, founding museums, and nation- building. He contrasts the presidencies of Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson. Throughout, Ambrose celebratesthe unflappable American spirit.,Most important, Ambrose writes about writing history. "The last five letters of the word 'history' tell us that it is an account of the past that is about people and what they did, which is what makes it the most fascinating of subjects.","To America" is an instant classic for all those interested in history, patriotism, and the love of writing.

Blurb: How successful have Southern African states been in dealing with the major issues that have faced the region in recent years? What could be done to produce more cohesive and effective region-building in Southern Africa? In this original and wide-ranging volume, which draws on an interdisciplinary team of mainly African and African-based specialists, the key political, socio-economic, and security challenges facing Southern Africa today are addressed. These include the various issues confronting the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and its institutions; such as HIV/AIDS, migration and xenophobia, land-grabbing and climate change; and the role of the main external actors involved with the region, including the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, and China. The book also looks at the Southern African Customs Union and Southern African Development Finance Institutions, including the Development Bank of Southern Africa and Industrial Development Corporation, and issues of gender and peacebuilding. In doing so, the book goes to the heart of analyzing the effectiveness of SADC and other regional organisation, suggesting how region-building in Southern Africa may be compared with similar attempts elsewhere in Africa and other parts of the world.

Blurb: The original French edition of this book, published in 1967, was widely acclaimed as the best introduction to Chinese Communism ever published. A fresh, bold interpretative survey, it focuses on the dynamic social forces underlying the Chinese Communists' rise in three short decades from obscurity to power.,The author seeks above all to relate the events of this tumultuous period to certain tentative generalizations about the nature and course of the revolution. He is concerned less with the May Fourth Movement as such, for example, than with the revolution's intellectual origins, less with the Communist party's early political history than with the place of Marxist ideology in that history, less with the military aspects of the war of 1937-45 than with the influence of nationalism in the growing success of the Communists.,An important part of the book deals with the various governmental and non-governmental attempt at reform during the Kuomintang era, which the author shows were too little too late to dam the swelling flood of revolution. The conclusion evaluates the crucial role of imperialism, the peasantry, and the army in the Chinese "formula" for revolution and re-examines the relationship between Marxism and the Chinese Revolution.

Blurb: Comic book legend Alan Moore (WATCHMEN, FROM HELL) and brilliant artist Jacen Burrows deliver a chilling tale of Lovecraftian horror! Brears and Lamper, two young and cocky FBI agents, investigate a fresh series of ritual murders somehow tied to the final undercover assignment of Aldo Sax the once golden boy of the Bureau, now a convicted killer and inmate of a maximum security prison. From their interrogation of Sax (where he spoke exclusively in inhuman tongues) to a related drug raid on a seedy rock club rife with arcane symbols and otherworldly lyrics, they suspect that they are on the trail of something awful but nothing can prepare them for the creeping insanity and unspeakable terrors they will face in the small harbor town of Innsmouth. NEONOMICON collects Alan Moores 2010 comic book series for the first time in its entirety  including his original story, THE COURTYARD, which chronicled Aldo Saxs tragic encounter with the (somewhat) mortal agents of the Old Ones!

Blurb: The Tour de France is sport's most compelling battle -- an annual cauldron of heroism and treachery, spectacle and controversy, mind-games and endurance.,But the 1986 Tour stands out as the year in which a show-stopping rivalry had spectators across the world gripped.,When Greg LeMond -- a blue-eyed, blonde-haired Californian boy, dubbed 'L'American' -- won the 1986 Tour, he made history. The first non-European to win the Yellow Jersey, he broke the Old World stranglehold and changed the face of the competition.,But LeMond's victory was hard won. It was seemingly snatched from the jaws of the man ominously dubbed 'The Badger'. Frenchman Bernard 'Le Blaireau' Hinault was five times winner of the Tour and as tough as boots. After winning the 1985 Tour, in which LeMond came a close second, Hinault vowed to return for one final Tour, and with a single purpose: to help LeMond win.,But could Hinault be trusted? As the race circled France, he repeatedly attacked LeMond. Hinault claimed to the press that his apparent treachery was merely intended to make LeMond stronger. But LeMond, who didn't believe him, became increasingly fearful, anxious and paranoid.,The Tour is renowned for its psychological complexity - but what played out in 1986 was unheard of. Why was Hinault putting his own teammate in jeopardy? Would LeMond crack under the pressure? Something sinister was going on but no one - not even LeMond -- knew quite what.,Slaying the Badger, relives the adrenaline, the agony, the camaraderie, the betrayals, and the pure exhilaration of the 1986 Tour. Richard Moore has interviewed all the key players including the story's two enigmatic, eccentric and fiercely different protagonists. As he delves behind the scenes, the biggest conundrum of Tour history is finally laid bare.

Blurb: What are the fundamental differences between classic and baroque art? Is there a pattern underlying the seemingly helter-skelter development of art in different cultures and at different times? What causes our entirely different reactions to precisely the same painting or to the same painter?,In this now-classic treatise, published originally in Germany in the early 1920s, Professor Wlfflin provides an objective set of criteria to answer these and related questions. Examining such factors as style, quality, and mode of representation in terms of five opposed dynamisms (the linear vs. painterly, plane vs. recession, closed vs. open form, multiplicity vs. unity, and clearness vs. unclearness), the author analyzes the work of 64 major artists, delving even into sculpture and architecture. 150 illustrations of the work of Botticelli, van Cleve, Durer, Holbein, Brueghel, Bouts, Hals, Rembrandt, Velasquez, Titian, Vermeer, and other major figures accompany Professor Wlfflin's brilliant contributions to the methodology of art criticism.,Whether you teach art, study it, or want to understand it purely for your own enjoyment, this epoch-making study will certainly increase your comprehension of and pleasure in the world's art heritage.

Blurb: Following the events of September 11, 2001, American Muslims found themselves under unprecedented scrutiny. Muslim communities in the United States suffered from negative representations of their religion, but they also experienced increased interest in aspects of their faith and cultures. They seized the opportunity to shape the intellectual contribution of American Muslims to contemporary Muslim thought as never before. Muslim women in particularoften assumed to be silenced, oppressed members of their own communitieschallenged stereotypes through their writing, seeking to express what it means to be a Muslim woman in America and carrying out intra-Muslim debates about gender roles and womens participation in society. Hammer looks at the work of significant female American Muslim writers, scholars, and activists, using their writings as a lens for a larger discussion of Muslim intellectual production in America and beyond. Centered on the controversial women-led Friday prayer in March 2005, Hammer uses this event and its aftermath to address themes of faith, community, and public opinion. Tracing the writings of American Muslim women since 1990, the author covers an extensive list of authors, including Amina Wadud, Leila Ahmed, Asma Barlas, Riffat Hassan, Mohja Kahf, Azizah al-Hibri, Asra Normani, and Asma Gull Hasan. Hammer deftly examines each authors writings, demonstrating that the debates that concern American Muslim women are at the heart of modern Muslim debates worldwide. While gender is the catalyst for Hammers study, her examination of these womens intellectual output touches on themes central to contemporary Islam: authority, tradition, Islamic law, justice, and authenticity.

Blurb: This book gives an account of the social and economic developments in Anglo-Saxon England from the first settlements in the fifth and sixth centuries to the immediate aftermath of the Norman conquest. The basic structure of analysis rests on the surviving legal and literary evidence, buttressed by the latest findings of archaeologists, numismatists, and art historians. In nearly 30 years since the first edition there has been great advance in knowledge, notably on the numismatic side, but the main themes remain constant and deal with a steady development from tribal institutions where the social power of the kindred is dominant towards the creation of a territorial kingdom where the chief bonds that keep a community together concern lordship in all its attributes.

Blurb: An old Soviet quip has it that Western amateurs play the opening like grandmasters, the middlegame like experts, and the endgame like beginners. Soviet-trained players would fearlessly steer the game toward the final phase, confident of their superior endgame skill. Ilya Rabinovichs Russian Endgame Manual is a major reason for this. Rabinovich raises the beginners understanding of the endgame to a sophisticated level, starting with elementary checkmates and then moving on to the principles for handling complex endgames and advanced concepts in king-and-pawn endings, such as the theory of corresponding squares. The author pays special attention to frequently neglected endgame themes such as rook vs. pawns, rook vs. a minor piece, and queen vs. rook. First published in 1927 and updated in 1938, this classic work - featuring more than four hundred instructive endings and over three hundred exercises for self-study - served a generation of players at the height of the Soviet Schools dominance. Mongoose Press now makes it available to the English-speaking public for the first time.

Sotto la sua direzione, si  costituito e ha acquisito rinomanza il Centro di Medicina Tradizionale di Bandiagara, un organismo multidisciplinare che studia gli aspetti simbolici della cura e sviluppa un progetto di collaborazione fra medicina tradizionale africana - l'arte dei guaritori - e i sistemi sanitari di base del paese. Elaborando il suo distacco da quel mondo, Coppo riordina pensieri e immagini, archivia brani di passato coloniale, rivive da epistemologo l'emozione dell'incontro con saperi ignorati e poteri che risanano, si scopre un estro di ritrattista nel disegnate figure che popolano l'altopiano, malati di "follia", capi dogon, giramondo, aggiustaossa: sopra tutti, le grandi figure di guaritori. Sono volti, paesaggi, storie, voci, che alla fine ricompongono un frammento d'Africa.

Blurb: From a single cell--a fertilized egg--comes an elephant, a fly, or a human. How does this astonishing feat happen? How does the egg know what to become? How does it divide into the different cells, the separate tissues, the brain, the fingernail--every tiniest detail of the growing fetus? In this ,Very Short Introduction,, renowned scientist Lewis Wolpert shows how the field of developmental biology seeks to answer these profound questions. A distinguished developmental biologist himself, Wolpert offers a concise and highly readable account of what we now know about development, discussing the first vital steps of growth, the patterning created by Hox genes and the development of form, embryonic stem cells, the timing of gene expression and its management, chemical signaling, and growth. Drawing on scientific breakthroughs in genetics, evolution, and molecular biology, he illuminates processes that are deeply rooted in evolutionary history, revealing how information is held in genes whose vital timing in switching on and off is orchestrated by a host of proteins expressed by other genes.

Blurb: From the author of the national bestseller ,Dead Man Walking ,comes a brave and fiercely argued new book that tests the moral edge of the debate on capital punishment: What if were executing innocent men? Two cases in point are Dobie Gillis Williams, an indigent black man with an IQ of 65, and Joseph Roger ODell. Both were convicted of murder on flimsy evidence (ODells principal accuser was a jailhouse informant who later recanted his testimony). Both were executed in spite of numerous appeals. Sister Helen Prejean watched both of them die.As she recounts these mens cases and takes us through their terrible last moments, Prejean brilliantly dismantles the legal and religious arguments that have been used to justify the death penalty. Riveting, moving, and ultimately damning, ,The Death of Innocents, is a book we dare not ignore.

A major part of the book comprises the species accounts, with complementary colour plates of 42 species and sub-species and detailed maps depicting the geography of their evolution. In addition there are chapters on the bee-eaters' evolutionary development, their food and foraging behaviour, and relationships with apiculture; of particular interest are chapters on social and reproductive life, the role of 'helpers' at the nest, and the meaning of plumage and social distinctions between the species.

Blurb: Put an end to painful power struggles with your children! , Why is it so difficult sometimes to get kids to listen? You ask your child to turn off the TV, do her homework, or get ready for school or bedtime. You know he heard you, but he ignores you. You ask again and still...no response. You've tried everything-time-outs, nagging, counting to three-and nothing seems to work., In ,If I Have to Tell You One More Time...,, founder of the popular online parenting course Positive Parenting Solutions Amy McCready presents a nag- and scream-free program for compassionately, yet effectively, correcting your children's bad behavior., In this invaluable book, McCready shows parents how an understanding of the psychological theory espoused by Alfred Adler (1870-1937) can put an end to power struggles in their households. Adlerian psychology focuses on the central idea that every human being has a basic need to feel powerful-with children being no exception to the rule. And when this need isn't met in positive ways, kids will resort to negative methods, which often result in some of the most frustrating behavior they exhibit. ,If I Have to Tell You One More Time..., provides the knowledge and tools parents need to address the deeper issues that inspire their children to misbehave. Read this book and rediscover the joy of parenting!

Blurb: We think of the Renaissance as a shining era of human achievementa pinnacle of artistic genius and humanist brilliance, the time of Shakespeare, Michelangelo, and Montaigne. Yet it was also an age of constant, harrowing warfare. Armies, not philosophers, shaped the face of Europe as modern nation-states emerged from feudal society. ,In ,Furies,, one of the leading scholars of Renaissance history captures the dark reality of the period in a gripping narrative mosaic. As Lauro Martines shows us, total war was no twentieth-century innovation. These conflicts spared no civilians in their path. A Renaissance army was a mobile city-indeed, a force of 20,000 or 40,000 men was larger than many cities of the day. And it was a monster, devouring food and supplies for miles around. It menaced towns and the countryside-and itself-with famine and disease, often more lethal than combat. Fighting itself was savage, its violence increased by the use of newly invented weapons, from muskets to mortars.,For centuries, notes Martines, the history of this period has favored diplomacy, high politics, and military tactics. Furies puts us on the front lines of battle, and on the streets of cities under siege, to reveal what Europes wars meant to the men and women who endured them.

Blurb: It Runs in the Family, is a memoir of faith and willful ignorance, truths and secrets, rural and urban labor, and fire: fire as both knowledge and destructive force.,Richard Manning was raised on a piece of farmland in Michigan, in a working- class family of Christian fundamentalists. Manning's father was a jack of many trades: farmer, carpenter, builder, power lineman, factory worker, small businessman. His mother concealed her own troubled childhood beneath a religious faith that explained away uncertainty, illness, and tragedy.,Manning grew up learning how to work and what to believe---but came to understand his family's seemingly-normal facade as a mask for troubling secrets. ,It Runs in the Family, is the story of Manning's journey away from his family, one that ranges from their Michigan farm to the fire-ravaged wilderness of Montana, and finally to a remote village in Panama, where he comes to pursue a past he had vowed to leave behind. Linking his own life with the larger story of his family, the land they inhabited, and the right-wing fundamentalist politics gaining ground in America, Richard Manning offers a singular memoir.

Blurb: An iconic collection of design work presented in fresh and useful format.Designers are conceptual pack rats. They pack as much raw material in their brains as possible and then use that to build their own unique designs. ,The Anatomy of Design, is what, in the butcher business, they call a "side of beef." The authors selected fifty examples of graphic design that will be dissected, piece by piece, tissue by tissue, revealing an array of influences and inspirations. These are not necessarily the most well-known or celebrated objects of graphic design, though many contain the genetic codes of some canonical works. Instead, these represent contemporary artifacts that are well conceived, finely crafted, and filled with hidden treasures. Some are overtly complex and their influences are somewhat easy to see with the naked eye. Others are so simple that it is hard to believe there is a storehouse of inspiration hidden underneath.,The selections include all kinds of design work including posters, book and record covers, packages, catalog covers, and more. Each exhibit is selected based on its ubiquity, thematic import, and aesthetic significance, and every page is a means to show how great work is derived from various inspirational and physical sources, some well-known, some unknown. Each design is presented on a gate-fold showing the featured design and and other works that share the key influences with extended captions explaining the whys and wherefores.

Blurb: For the first time since 1984, we have a new edition of the classic book that ,Field & Stream, called "the Hiker's Bible." For this version, the celebrated writer and hiker Colin Fletcher has taken on a coauthor, Chip Rawlins, himself an avid outdoorsman and a poet from Wyoming. Together, they have made this fourth edition of ,The Complete Walker, the most informative, entertaining, and thorough version yet.,The eighteen years since the publication of ,The Complete Walker III, have seen revolutionary changes in hiking and camping equipment: developments in waterproofing technology, smaller and more durable stoves, lighter boots, more manageable tents, and a wider array of food options. The equipment recommendations are therefore not merely revised and tweaked, but completely revamped. During these two decades we have also seen a deepening of environmental consciousness. Not only has backpacking become more popular, but a whole ethic of responsible outdoorsmanship has emerged. In this book the authors confidently lead us through these technological, ethical, and spiritual changes.,Fletcher and Rawlins's thorough appraisal and recommendation of equipment begins with a "Ground Plan," a discussion of general hiking preparedness. How much to bring? What are the ideal clothes, food, boots, and tents for your trip? They evaluate each of these variables in detail--including open, honest critiques and endorsements of brand-name equipment. Their equipment searches are exhaustive; they talk in detail about everything from socks to freeze-dried trail curries.,They end as they began, with a philosophical and literary disquisition on the reasons to walk, capped off with a delightful collection of quotes about walking and the outdoor life. After a thoughtful and painstaking analysis of hiking gear from hats to boots, from longjohns to tent flaps, they remind us that ultimately hiking is about the experience of being outdoors and seeing the green world anew.,Like its predecessors, ,The Complete Walker IV, is an essential purchase for anyone captivated by the outdoor life.

Blurb: This alternate history of the Allied D-Day landings is based very firmly on fact and is a brilliant study of how a campaign could lead to unexpected results. It is June 1944. The Allied armies are poised for the full-scale invasion of Fortress Europe. Across the Channel, the vaunted Wehrmacht lies waiting for the first signs of the invasion, ready for the final battle. What happens next is well known to any student of modern history - but the outcome could have been very different, as Peter Tsouras shows in this devastating account of a D-Day in which plans, missions and landings go horribly wrong. Peter Tsouras introduces minor adjustments at the opening of the campaign - the repositioning of a unit, bad weather and misjudged orders - and examines their effect as they gather momentum and impact upon all subsequent events. Without deviating from the genuine possibilities of the situation, he presents a scenario that keeps the reader guessing and changes the course of history.

Blurb: This popular introduction to CMOS VLSI design has been revised extensively to reflect changes in the technology and trends in the industry. Covering CMOS design from a digital systems level to the circuit level, and providing a background in CMOS processing technology, the book includes both an explanation of basic theory and a guide to good engineering practice. The material is of use to designers employing gate array, standard cell, or custom design approaches. Since the first edition appeared, CMOS technology has assumed a central position in modern electronic system design. Processes have grown denser, and automated design tools have become common, leading to far more complex chips operating at much higher speeds. With these advances, CMOS design approaches have changed, reflected here in greater emphasis on clocking, power distribution, design margining, and testing.

Blurb: A time-travel story that is both a poignant exploration of human identity and an absorbing tale of suspense.,It's natural to feel a little out of place when you're the new girl, but when Charlotte Makepeace wakes up after her first night at boarding school, she's baffled: everyone thinks she's a girl called Clare Mobley, and even more shockingly, it seems she has traveled forty years back in time to 1918. In the months to follow, Charlotte wakes alternately in her own time and in Clare's. And instead of having only one new set of rules to learn, she also has to contend with the unprecedented strangeness of being an entirely new person in an era she knows nothing about. Her teachers think she's slow, the other girls find her odd, and, as she spends more and more time in 1918, Charlotte starts to wonder if she remembers how to be Charlotte at all. If she doesn't figure out some way to get back to the world she knows before the end of the term, she might never have another chance.

It takes account of important recent advances in Hittite scholarship, including some major archaeological discoveries made in the last few years. It also features numerous translations from the original texts, so that on many issues the ancient Hittites are given the opportunity to speak to the modern reader for themselves.

Blurb: Imagine knowing what the brain craves from every tale it encounters, what fuels the success of any great story, and what keeps readers transfixed. ,Wired for Story, reveals these cognitive secrets--and it's a game-changer for anyone who has ever set pen to paper. The vast majority of writing advice focuses on writing well as if it were the same as telling a great story. This is exactly where many aspiring writers fail--they strive for beautiful metaphors, authentic dialogue, and interesting characters, losing sight of the one thing that every engaging story must do: ignite the brain's hardwired desire to learn what happens next. When writers tap into the evolutionary purpose of story and electrify our curiosity, it triggers a delicious dopamine rush that tells us to pay attention. Without it, even the most perfect prose won't hold anyone's interest. Backed by recent breakthroughs in neuroscience as well as examples from novels, screenplays, and short stories, ,Wired for Story, offers a revolutionary look at story as the brain experiences it. Each chapter zeroes in on an aspect of the brain, its corresponding revelation about story, and the way to apply it to your storytelling right now.

Blurb: The recently deceased French-American sculptor Louise Bourgeois (1911-2010) was one of the most important artists of the last century. Her fleshy blobs, skeletal spiders and the aggressive fragility of her work offered a new solution to the antagonism between the figurative and the abstract that had previously been part and parcel of modernism. Bourgeois herself provided a unique interpretive level to modern art through the uses she made of childhood trauma, family life and sexuality. This accessible study serves as both an ideal introduction to the central themes of the late artist's oeuvre and as a commemoration of her one-hundredth birthday. Over the course of nine chapters, it examines her life, her exploration of the works of other artists and the transformation of her emotions into such works of art as the now iconic pieces -Destruction of the Father, - -Fillette, - -Cells- and -Maman.-

Blurb: A perfect book to introduce Westerners to Tibetan Buddhism. This is the genuinely compelling story, and spiritual odyssey, of Ole and Hannah Nydahl, who in 1968 became the first Western students of the great Tibetan master, His Holiness the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa. Their exciting travels on the worn path between the green lowlands of Europe to the peaks of the Himalayas, led them to experience the skillful teachings of numerous Tibetan lamas who helped transform their lives into "limitless clarity and joy." From their first contact with Tibetan Buddhism in Kathmandu in the form of a lama with extraordinary psychic powers, Ole and Hannah encountered the full spectrum of the Buddhist "view." Their aim in writing this book is "to form a bridge between two worlds, and especially to share with all who are looking for their true being ... an introduction to a time-proven way to Enlightenment." "One cannot really transmit anything, except what one has directly experienced, and the reason many of you will be able to identify with what happened to us is that, deep within, we are so very much alike."

Blurb: This is the story of Elspeth Lamond and the MacHugh. Elspeth is a provocative and feminine lass who lived in a turbulent time in Scotland's history, a period crowded with romance, intrigue, battles and characters that are memorable for their vitality and charm, their lust, strength and willfulness. Alexander MacHugh was head of one of Scotland's mightiest clans when the rebellious Highlanders rallied around the MacDonald banner. He was a man of massive will but gravely courteous demeanor, and he clashed with Elspeth at every encounter, his will pitted against hers, neither of them willing to surrender to an irresistible attraction.,It was early in the seventeenth century in Scotland, and the men and women who lived, loved and fought then were no less stormy and unpredictable than the violent events which caught them up and determined their fates. In these pages you will meet the corrupt and ambitious Earl of Argyll, Elspeth's wily guardian, who epitomizes an insatiable greed for power and wealth; Kate MacLachlan, the beautiful and treacherous redhead, whose passion for Alexander MacHugh would stop at nothing for fulfillment; Gavin, the grim and mysterious youth with a scar across his cheek; Elspeth's half-sister, Jeanie Lamond, as fair and fresh as a May morning, and, of course, the many brave and gallant Scottish rebels, led by the MacDonalds, who harried the Campbells and would not be subdued by England.,It seemed just another day when Elspeth Lamond rode into the wild and untameable hills and moors of the Highlands on a quiet mission from London, but within a few hours she was a captive riding in the rain toward an unknown destination. From the day of her abduction by a band of rough horsemen till the day she fled the thick walls of her guardian's castle, Elspeth's fate was irrevocably linked with the Lamonds and with their friend, the MacHugh, whose name reverberates through these pages with the vigor of a clash of arms.

Blurb: Ann Szedlecki was a Hollywood film-loving fourteen-year-old when the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939 and she went to the Soviet Union with her older brother, hoping to return for the rest of her family later. Instead, she ends up spending most of the next six and a half years alone in the Soviet Union, enduring the harsh conditions of northern Siberia under Stalin's Communist regime. Szedlecki's beautifully written story, which lovingly re-constructs her pre-war childhood in Lodz, is also compelling for its candour about her experiences as a woman in the Soviet Union during World War II. As a very young woman without family, living largely by her wits, she is only too aware of her own vulnerability and meets every challenge she faces with a fierce determination to survive. Throughout her ordeals she hears the echo of her mother's last words to her: "Be decent."

Blurb: The shadow war between Israel and Iran has been raging for more than three decades, ever since the Iranian revolution of 1979 ushered in a fundamentalist regime whose sworn enemies have consistently included, first and foremost, Israel and the United States. Israel, especially, has borne the brunt of attacks from Irans two most powerful proxiesHamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Irans nuclear ambitions raise the stakes immeasurably. Israel vs. Iran evaluates the threat to Israels security posed by a nuclear Iran, including competing perceptions of the threat, and analyzes Israels military and diplomatic options., Drawing on in-depth research and invaluable access to the Israeli defense establishment, including interviews with key decision makers, Israeli military correspondent Yaakov Katz and Israeli military historian Yoaz Hendel describe behind-the-scenes Israeli strategic military deliberations and intelligence analysis since the Second Lebanon War of 2006. The authors focus on pivotal military events in this shadow war with Iran, including the Syrian reactor bombing and Operation Cast Lead in the Gaza Strip, as well as assassinations of key Hezbollah operatives, Iranian nuclear scientists, and Syrian officials., Assassinations, computer viruses, and Western sanctions might not be enough to stop Iran, the authors argue. They outline the choice Israel faces: launch a military strike, which could lead to an all-out regional war, or tacitly accept a nuclear Iran, which would lead to a new balance of power in the Middle East. In 2012 Israel appears closer than ever to making a decision.

Blurb: In this lively and engaging new biography, Harry Kelsey shatters the familiar image of Sir Francis Drake. The Drake of legend was a pious, brave, and just seaman who initiated the move to make England a great naval power and whose acts of piracy against his countrys enemies earned him a knighthood for patriotism. Kelsey paints a different and far more interesting picture of Drake as an amoral privateer at least as interested in lining his pockets with Spanish booty as in forwarding the political goals of his country, a man who became a captain general of the English navy, but never waged traditional warfare with any success.,Drawing on much new evidence, Kelsey describes Drakes early life as the son of a poor family in sixteenth-century England. He explains how Drake dabbled in piracy, gained modest success as a merchant, and then took advantage of the hostility between Spain and England to embark on a series of daring pirate raids on undefended Spanish ships and ports, preempting Spanish demands for punishment by sharing much of his booty with the Queen and her councillors. Elizabeth I liked Drake because he was a charming rogue, and she made him an integral part of her war plans against Spain and its armada, but she quickly learned not to trust him with an important command: he was unable to handle a large fleet, was suspicious almost to the point of paranoia, and had no understanding of personal loyalty. For Drake, the mark of success was to amass great wealth, preferably by taking it from someone else and the primary purpose of warfare was to afford him the opportunity to accomplish this.

Blurb: Straddled between the world's two major energy basins, the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea, and possessing a rich reservoir of hydrocarbon resources as well as diverse minerals, Iran has always been economically significant. The Islamic Revolution thrust the country back onto the political centre-stage, and dramatically altered relations between Iran and the West.This book looks at these developments within an historical context. It charts how Iran sought to respond to the challenge of the West through reform and revolution, and to reverse the deline of the previous century with an ambitious programme of development. Combining detailed historical narrative with comprehensive analysis and explanation, Ali Ansari presents a new interpretation of the complex cultural polity that is modern Iran.

Blurb: In Ripening Seed Colette captures that precious, painful moment when childhood retreats at the onslaught of dawning knowledge and desire. Philippe and Vinca are childhood friends. In the glowing days and mist-filled nights of late summer on the Brittany coast, their deep-rooted love for each other loses its childhood simplicity. Philippe is destined to learn from experience, while Vinca, like all women the world over, is blessed, or cursed, with instinctive powers of perception and wisdom. Sharp and sad, haunted on every page by the sights, smells and sounds of the sea coast, this evocation of wounded, and wounding, innocence will be read with tears of sympathy and deep, lasting pleasure.

This collection, nearly all chosen by Boolos himself shortly before his death, includes thirty papers on set theory, second-order logic, and plural quantifiers; on Frege, Dedekind, Cantor, and Russell; and on miscellaneous topics in logic and proof theory, including three papers on various aspects of the GOdel theorems. Boolos is universally recognized as the leader in the renewed interest in studies of Frege's work on logic and the philosophy of mathematics. John Burgess has provided introductions to each of the three parts of the volume, and also an afterword on Boolos's technical work in provability logic, which is beyond the scope of this volume.

Blurb: In an America devastated by war and plague, the only way to survive is to keep moving.,In the aftermath of a war, Americas landscape has been ravaged and two-thirds of the population left dead from a vicious strain of influenza. Fifteen-year-old Stephen Quinn and his family were among the few that survived and became salvagers, roaming the country in search of material to trade. But when Stephens grandfather dies and his father falls into a coma after an accident, Stephen finds his way to Settlers Landing, a community that seems too good to be true. Then Stephen meets strong, defiant, mischievous Jenny, who refuses to accept things as they are. And when they play a prank that goes horribly wrong, chaos erupts, and they find themselves in the midst of a battle that will change Settlers Landing--and their lives--forever.

Blurb: "More than just a hilarious and raucous romp (which it is), ,Fowl Weather, shows how a parrot, or a rabbit, or a duck, or a cat, can teach us more about ourselves and about the chaos of the world than any therapist or philosopher.",Sara Gruen, author of Water for Elephants In Bob Tarte's home, pandemonium is the order of the day, and animals literally rule the roostthirty-nine of them at last count. Whether it's the knot-tying African grey parrot, or the overweight cat who's trained Bob to hold her water bowl just above the floor, or the nightmarish duck who challenges him to a shoving match, this menagerie, along with his endlessly optimistic wife, Linda, provides daily lessons on the chaos inherent in our lives. But not until this modern-day Noah's Ark hits stormy weatherand Bob's world spins out of controldoes he realize that this exuberant gaggle of animals provides his spiritual anchor. It is their alien presence, their sense of humor, and their impulsive behavior that both drive Bob crazy and paradoxically return him to sanity., With the same sly humor and dead-on character portraits that made ,Enslaved by Ducks, such a rousing success, Tarte proves that life with animals offers a wholly different perspective on the world.

Both residents and visitors alike enjoy Asheville's wealth of breweries, brewpubs, beer festivals and dedicated retailers. That enthusiasm earned the city the coveted Beer City, USA title year after year and prompted West Coast beer giants Sierra Nevada, New Belgium and Oskar Blues to establish production facilities here. Beer writer and educator Anne Fitten Glenn recounts this intoxicating history, from the suds-soaked saloons of "Hell's Half Acre" to the region's explosion into a beer Mecca.

Blurb: New York's urban neighborhoods are full of young would-be emcees who aspire to "keep it real" and restaurants like Sylvia's famous soul food eatery that offer a taste of "authentic" black culture. In these and other venues, authenticity is considered the best way to distinguish the real from the phony, the genuine from the fake. But in ,Real Black,, John L. Jackson Jr. proposes a new model for thinking about these issues,racial sincerity. ,Jackson argues that authenticity caricatures identity as something imposed on people, imprisoning them within stereotypes: an African American high school student who excels in the classroom, for instance, might be dismissed as "acting white." On the other hand, sincerity, as Jackson defines it, imagines authenticity as an incomplete measuring stick, an analytical model that attempts to deny people agency in their search for identity. ,Drawing on more than ten years of ethnographic research in and around New York City, Jackson offers a kaleidoscope of subjects and stories that directly and indirectly address how race is negotiated in today's worldincluding tales of book-vending numerologists, urban conspiracy theorists, corrupt police officers, mixed-race neo-Nazis, and gospel choirs forbidden to catch the Holy Ghost. Jackson records and retells their interconnected sagas, all the while attempting to reconcile these stories with his own crisis of identity and authority as an anthropologist terrified by fieldwork. Finding ethnographic significance where mere mortals see only bricks and mortar, his invented alter ego Anthroman takes to the streets, showing how race is defined and debated, imposed and confounded every single day.

Blurb: Nelle opere d'arte figurative e plastiche Beethoven ha assunto diverse sembianze, non tutte egualmente note poich alcune sono pi riprodotte di altre. Allineando in una galleria quei ritratti di natura eterogenea (olii su tela, incisioni e litografie, disegni, maschere facciali e busti) che furono realizzati durante la sua vita, emerge un profilo del compositore talvolta inedito e sorprendente. I ritratti sono qui considerati innanzitutto per il loro valore documentale e per la prima volta vengono definite, secondo un nuovo criterio metodologico, le peculiarit materiali delle opere (genesi, caratteristiche iconografiche, trasmissione, attuale collocazione), oltre alla discussione di una vasta quanto inesplorata letteratura critica. La vicenda iconografica procede parallelamente al racconto della biografia attraverso l'epistolario beethoveniano e le immagini letterarie che i contemporanei hanno tramandato sulla stampa dell'epoca e nella letteratura memorialistica. Ritratti e immagini forniscono cos, integrandosi a vicenda, uno sguardo approfondito sulla figura e sulla vita del maestro. Completano il volume due appendici dedicate alle biografie degli autori dei ritratti e degli innumerevoli amici, mecenati ed editori che permettono la ricostruzione del complicato tessuto di relazioni sociali in cui Beethoven visse.

Blurb: A CLASSIC MEMOIR OF TWO PIONEERING ADVENTURERS Before Joy Adamson went to Africa, before Margaret Mead sailed to Samoa, before Dian Fossey was even born, a Kansas teenager named Osa Leighty married Martin Johnson, a pioneering photographer just back from a 'round-the-world cruise with Jack London. Together the Johnsons flew and sailed to Borneo, to Kenya, and to the Congo, filming Simba and other popular nature movies with Martin behind the camera and Osa holding her rifle at the ready in case the scene's big game star should turn hostile. This bestselling memoir retraces their careers in rich detail, with precisely observed descriptions and often heart-stopping anecdotes. Illustrated with scores of the dramatic photos that made the Johnsons famous, it's a book sure to delight every lover of true adventure.

Blurb: If John Gierach is living in a fool's paradise, then it's a paradise that his regular readers will recognize and new fans will delight in discovering. Laced with the inimitable blend of wit and wisdom that have made him fly-fishing's foremost scribe, "Fool's Paradise" chronicles the fishing life in all its glory (catching your biggest fish ever) and squalor (being stranded in a tent during a soaking rainstorm). In Gierach's world, both experiences are valuable, and both evoke humor and insight.Fishermen everywhere will understand Gierach's quest to discover and explore new waters (and then not to divulge the best locations to anyone), the unlikely appeal of winter fly-fishing ("the ice fishing shanty served the dual purpose of group therapy and the neighborhood tavern"), how impossible it is to predict the best fishing ("Everything that happens is entirely familiar, but I don't always see it coming"), or even the absurdity of the entire exercise ("day after day, you're casting a fly that doesn't look like anything to fish that aren't hungry and may not even be there"). Braving trips on small prop planes and down "Oh-My-God" roads alike, Gierach and his fishing buddies pursue bull trout in British Columbia, steelhead in the Rocky Mountains, and pike so fierce that a wise fisherman wears Kevlar gloves for the obligatory trophy photo.,But as with any activity that depends on unspoiled wilderness, change is constant. Gierach sees this happening both in the landscape ("You never get to point at a meadow full of browsing mule deer and say, 'You know, all this was once condos.'") and at lodges that now require guests to sign liability waivers ("[I] had a brief vision of herds of lawyers coursing over the tundra in search of litigation"). Just the same, he is always awed by the experience of nature, or as he puts it: "You're on a lovely, remote wilderness river in the Alaskan backcountry. There are people who would make this trip and not even bring a fishing rod.",Musing on the enduring appeal of fishing, Gierach theorizes, "We're so used to the fake and the packaged that encountering something real can amount to a borderline religious experience." Equal parts fishing lore, philosophy, and great fish stories, "Fool's Paradise" may not be a perfect substitute for actually being out on the water, but it's surely the next best thing.

Blurb: After the publication of his first novel, SANDEL, Angus Stewart went to Tangier to escape 'orthodox Western living', and, with very little money, plunged immediately into a captivating alien world.,His Tangier is not the picturesque town of the tourists, nor indeed the superficial scene of squalor and deprivation sometimes observed by journalists. Instead he shows how within their own terms the people of Tangier live, and how their individual customs and perceptions have been shaped out of a decidedly tortuous history.,We enter a world in which most of what in the West we take for granted -- money, food, entertainment, family life -- have entirely different meanings, where hashish, not alcohol, is socially acceptable, and where eccentricities are encouraged, not stifled.,At the same time, the flavour of Morocco, and especially of Tangier, is shown to be very subtle, and the social customs and codes to be of great complexity.,The story of Angus Stewart's battles with authority, and his encounters with some of the towering characters of the city, is often hilarious, and always moving.,Altogether this is a perfect guide, not so much to the hotels and restaurants (although some are mentioned) but to the spirit of the city. ,Illustrated with the author's own photographs.

Blurb: What is style in architecture? Style is like a feather in a woman's hat, nothing more, said Le Corbusier, expressing most modern architects' low regard for the subject. But Witold Rybczynski disagrees, and in ,The Look of Architecture,, he makes a compelling case for the importance of style to the mother of the arts., This is a book brimming with sharp observations--that form does not follow function; that the best architecture is not timeless but precisely of its time; that details do not merely complement the architecture--details ,are, the architecture. But the heart of the book illuminates the connection between architecture, interior decoration, and fashion. Style is the language of architecture, Rybczynski writes, and fashion represents the wide and swirling cultural currents that shape and direct that language. The two--style and fashion--are intimately linked; indeed, architecture cannot escape fashion. To set these ideas in sharp relief, he shows us how style and fashion have been expressed in the work of major architects including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Charles McKim, Allan Greenberg, Robert Venturi, Enrique Norten, and many others. He helps us see their works anew and ultimately to look afresh at our surroundings., Style is one of the enduring--and endearing--aspects of architecture, Rybczynski concludes. Furthermore, an architecture that recognizes the importance of style would not be as introspective and self-referential as are so many contemporary buildings. It would be part of the world: Not architecture for architects, but for the rest of us.

Scerri looks at the trends in properties of elements that led to the construction of the periodic table, and how the deeper meaning of its structure gradually became apparent with the development of atomic theory and quantum mechanics, so that physics arguably came to colonize an entirely different science, chemistry.

Blurb: Erik Weihenmayer, was born with retinoscheses, a degenerative eye disorder that would leave him blind by the age of thirteen. But Erik was determined to rise above this devastating disability and lead a fulfilling and exciting life. ,In this poignant and inspiring memoir, he shares his struggle to push past the limits imposed on him by his visual impairment-and by a seeing world. He speaks movingly of the role his family played in his battle to break through the barriers of blindness: the mother who prayed for the miracle that would restore her son's sight and the father who encouraged him to strive for that distant mountaintop. And he tells the story of his dream to climb the world's Seven Summits, and how he is turning that dream into astonishing reality (something fewer than a hundred mountaineers have done). ,From the snow-capped summit of McKinley to the towering peaks of Aconcagua and Kilimanjaro to the ultimate challenge, Mount Everest, this is a story about daring to dream in the face of impossible odds. It is about finding the courage to reach for that ultimate summit, and transforming your life into something truly miraculous.,"I admire you immensely. You are an inspiration to other blind people and plenty of folks who can see just fine." (Jon Krakauer, author of ,Into Thin Air,)

Blurb: For decades, Mexico has been one of the worlds top non-OPEC oil exporters, but since the 2004 peak and subsequent decline of the massive offshore oilfieldCantarellthe prospects for the country have worsened. Living with Oil takes a unique look at the cultural and economic dilemmas in this locale, focusing on residents in the fishing community of Isla Aguada, Campeche, who experienced the long-term repercussions of a 1979 oil spill that at its height poured out 30,000 barrels a day, a blowout eerily similar to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster.,Tracing the interplay of the global energy market and the struggle it creates between citizens, the state, and multinational corporations, this study also provides lessons in the tug-of-war between environmentalism and the lure of profits. In Mexico, oil has held status as a symbol of nationalist pride as well as a key economic asset that supports the states everyday operations. Capturing these dilemmas in a country now facing a national security crisis at the hands of violent drug traffickers, cultural anthropologist Lisa Breglia covers issues of sovereignty, security, and stability in Mexicos post-peak future.,The first in-depth account of the local effects of peak oil in Mexico, emphasizing the everyday lives and livelihoods of coastal Campeche residents, Living with Oil demonstrates important aspects of the political economy of energy while showing vivid links between the global energy marketplace and the individual lives it affects.

Blurb: On completion of her training as an agent of the interstellar federations Anthropological Service, Elana is sent to a world whose people may soon destroy their civilization. Since not enough is understood about the situation to justify any interference with their evolution, the Service has no power to act; its agents must go as helpless observers, posing as natives, in the hope of gaining knowledge that may help to save other worlds. This passive role proves intolerable to the young, inexperienced agent assigned to the same city as Elana, a city under totalitarian rule. After falling in love with a local girl who has become Elana's closest friend, he identifies too completely with the natives and unwittingly endangers the entire world by a well-meant but ill-advised attempt to intervene. Forced to assume responsibility for undoing the damage, Elana finds that only she--at great cost--can prevent an immediate war of annihilation.,Although this book has the same heroine as Enchantress from the Stars, it should not be considered a sequel, as it is a completely independent story that is not appropriate for readers as young as many who enjoy the earlier book. Older teens and adults can read the two in either order.,Please note that this book had significant updating when republished. Editions dated earlier than 2003 are in some respects obsolete.

Blurb: When four religious leaders walk across the road, it's not the beginning of a joke. It's the start of one of the most important conversations in today's world. ,Can you be a committed Christian without having to condemn or convert people of other faiths? Is it possible to affirm other religious traditions without watering down your own? ,In his most important book yet, widely acclaimed author and speaker Brian McLaren proposes a new faith alternative, one built on "benevolence and solidarity rather than rivalry and hostility." This way of being Christian is strong but doesn't strong-arm anyone, going beyond mere tolerance to vigorous hospitality toward, interest in, and collaboration with the other. ,Blending history, narrative, and brilliant insight, McLaren shows readers step-by-step how to reclaim this strong-benevolent faith, challenging us to stop creating barriers in the name of God and learn how affirming other religions can strengthen our commitment to our own. And in doing so, he invites Christians to become more Christ-like than ever before.

Blurb: A fine introduction to Puritan preaching, this little book also recalls one of the great turning points in English Christianity--for these sermons were preached on 'the Farewell Sunday' in August, 1662, when two thousand ministers left the national Church for conscience' sake. Much has been written on that Great Ejection, but nothing is more important than to hear the ejected speak for themselves. Their watchword was: , I preach as never sure to preach again, and as a dying man to dying men. ,This new edition of , Sermons of the Great Ejection , not only commemorates the 350th anniversary of a noteworthy historical event but, more importantly, gives a real insight into the theology, godliness, and preaching of the Puritans. Why is this relevant? For two reasons: (i) as the blurb on the first edition said, 'such preaching could set England alight again in our own times'; and (ii) the issues of 1662 are directly relevant to the present situation in the church when the emphasis is once again upon conformity and unity at the expense of truth and holiness. May this little book be an encouragement to men of gospel truth and integrity everywhere.

Blurb: The very idea of empire was created in ancient Rome and even today traces of its monuments, literature, and institutions can be found across Europe, the Near East, and North Africa--and sometimes even further afield.,In ,Rome,, historian Greg Woolf expertly recounts how this mammoth empire was created, how it was sustained in crisis, and how it shaped the world of its rulers and subjects--a story spanning a millennium and a half of history. The personalities and events of Roman history have become part of the West's cultural lexicon, and Woolf provides brilliant retellings of each of these, from the war with Carthage to Octavian's victory over Cleopatra, from the height of territorial expansion under the emperors Trajan and Hadrian to the founding of Constantinople and the barbarian invasions which resulted in Rome's ultimate collapse. Throughout, Woolf carefully considers the conditions that made Rome's success possible and so durable, covering topics as diverse as ecology, slavery, and religion. Woolf also compares Rome to other ancient empires and to its many later imitators, bringing into vivid relief the Empire's most distinctive and enduring features.,As Woolf demonstrates, nobody ever planned to create a state that would last more than a millennium and a half, yet Rome was able, in the end, to survive barbarian migrations, economic collapse and even the conflicts between a series of world religions that had grown up within its borders, in the process generating an image and a myth of empire that is apparently indestructible. Based on new research and compellingly told, this sweeping account promises to eclipse all previously published histories of the empire.

Blurb: DORA WANTS TO MAKE LOVE,Specifically, Dora wants to make love with the handsome Rystani warrior-pilot Zical. But since Dora is a computer-albeit a sentient computer-she cannot experience touch, taste and true desire. Dora's logic functions refuse to accept this, so she uses the advanced technology of the 24th century to build herself a body specifically crafted to appeal to Zical, and downloads her computer brain into it.,But Dora's sassy attitude makes her too different from the women of Zical's culture. He's attracted to Dora, but he won't make love to her. And while it would be easy for Dora to adapt to his desires, she likes being smart and funny; she's becoming good at being human.,When Zical accidentally summons the ancient machines that protect the galaxy from invasion, Dora's mission is to intercept them and bring them back to the galaxy's rim. Fortunately for Dora, this puts her and Zical into very close quarters for a very long time. But much has changed, and as Dora learns more about human emotions and what they mean, she realizes that she doesn't just want to make love with Zical--she wants to love him. And be loved in return.

Blurb: The development of the Baha'i Faith from the messianic Babi movement in nineteenth-century Iran to become an independent religion established in many countries and commanding the devotion of people from many different cultures provides a vivid example of religious change in the modern world. The process is more fully documented than that by which any other religion emerged and Peter Smith is able to trace in detail the development of the major beliefs and values in their social and historical contexts. Beginning with the rise of the dissident Babi sect within Shi'i Islam, the book examines the origin of the Baha'i Faith and its dominant religious concerns in Qajar Iran, its initial establishment and subsequent growth in the United States, the development of its administration, and its present global expansion. A conclusion outlines possible future developments. Chronologies of the main events, a glossary and a bibliographical guide add to the usefulness of the book for both students and general readers.

Blurb: A "lot lizard" is a female hooker who works a highway truck stop as her territory. When trucker Bill Ketter looks for a little relaxation and release, he discovers, too late, that he has bitten off more than he can chew. In fact, his lot lizard is the one that does the biting--she is a vampire, one of number who move from one truck stop to the next under the watchful and vicious eyes of the repulsive Carsey Brothers. Against his will, Bill becomes one of the undead. He follows the brothers and their cargo to another stop where he meets his ex-wife and children and Bill finds himself battling the vampires and their age-old leader for the life of his teenaged son. Garton has created another small masterpiece, contemporary adult horror at its most gruesome and loaded with extras doses of sex and gore. The confined setting creates a perfect claustrophobic stage for the story and the hellaciously quick pace never lets the action slow down.

Blurb: The inspiration and insight of these Gnostic writings can become a companion on your own spiritual journey. ,Just what is a soul, exactly? Where did the idea come from? How do we experience our souls? Two ancient Gnostic texts--,The Exegesis on the Soul ,and ,The Hymn of the Pearl, , both presented here in all-new translations--hold important clues to the development of the soul as a concept and reveal inspiring ways your own soul can remember and return to its unique, divine purpose.,The Exegesis on the Soul, depicts the soul as a feminine figure who has fallen into the corrupted world and must find her way back to the Divine. It is the story of the soul's struggle and redemption that will embolden your own spiritual pilgrimage. ,The Hymn of the Pearl, is an allegorical story about a prince sent to retrieve a precious pearl but who soon forgets his purpose and falls asleep. It is a moving tale of the importance of remembering your soul's identity and calling--and knowing that only you can fulfill your destiny.,Accessible facing-page commentary explains the Gnostic writings for you even if you have no previous knowledge of Gnosticism or early Christianity. Additional material draws on ancient religions, Platonism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and modern philosophical and psychological notions of the soul to place the Gnostic teachings in a clear historical context. By following the development of this concept through time, you will more clearly perceive--and respond to--the divine spark found in your own soul.

Blurb: A vast amount of literature-both scholarly and popular-now exists on the subject of historical memory, but there is remarkably little available that is written from an African perspective. This volume explores the inner dynamics of memory in all its variations, from its most destructive and divisive impact to its remarkable potential to heal and reconcile. It addresses issues on both the conceptual and the pragmatic level and its theoretical observations and reflections are informed by first-hand experiences and comparative reflections from a German, Indian, and Korean perspective. A new insight is the importance of the future dimension of memory and hence the need to develop the ability to 'remember with the future in mind'. Historical memory in an African context provides a rich kaleidoscope of the diverse experiences and perspectives-and yet there are recurring themes and similar conclusions, connecting it to a global dialogue to which it has much to contribute, but from which it also has much to receive.

Blurb: The stories in Betty Superman are true, except when they're not. They're based on Tiff Hollands relationship with her mother, a story arc all its own, only Betty isn't her mother and Hollands not the narrator, not completely. Over the course of the chapbook, both Betty and the narrator suffer from serious illnesses. One of them is recovering; one of them is not. Consequently, theyve ended up spending more time together. They have "adventures," as Betty calls them, and really talk for probably the first time in their lives. They inexplicably find themselves in Bettys red PT Cruiser driving around to Walgreen's and Cracker Barrel, selling gold for cash, and pumping gas. In unsentimental and percussive prose, Holland examines Betty as character, dragon lady, mother, and reluctant superhero.

Blurb: In some circles, a nod towards totalitarianism is enough to dismiss any critique of the status quo. Such is the insidiousness of the neo-liberal ideology, argues Slavoj iek. ,Did Somebody Say Totalitarianism?, turns a specious rhetorical strategy on its head to identify a network of family resemblances between totalitarianism and modern liberal democracy.iek argues that totalitarianism is invariably defined in terms of four things: the Holocaust as the ultimate, diabolical evil; the Stalinist gulag as the alleged truth of the socialist revolutionary project; ethnic and religious fundamentalisms, which are to be fought through multiculturalist tolerance; and the deconstructionist idea that the ultimate root of totalitarianism is the ontological closure of thought. iek concludes that the devil lies not so much in the detail but in what enables the very designation totalitarian: the liberal-democratic consensus itself.

Blurb: From their commanding role in the so-called British Invasion of the early 1960s to their status as the elder statesmen (and British Knight) of rock and roll, the Stones have become more than an evanescent phenomenon in pop culture. They have become a touchstone not only for the history of our timestheir performance at the Altamont Raceway marked the "end of the sixties," while their 1990 concert in Prague helped Czechoslovakia and other eastern bloc nations celebrate their newfound freedom (and satisfaction) out from under Moscows thumb. Because of their longevity, the music and career of the Stonesmuch more than The Beatlesstand as touchstones in the personal lives of even casual Stones fans. Everyone of a certain age remembers the Stones on Ed Sullivan, the death of founder Brian Jones, their favorite songs, concerts, or videos, and their stance in the classic Beatles versus Stones debates. In the wake of Keith Richardss bestselling autobiography, ,Life, (2010), many are now reliving these events and decades from the viewpoint of the bands endearing and seemingly death-defying guitarist.,The chapters in ,The Rolling Stones and Philosophy, celebrate the Stones place in our lives by digging into the controversies, the symbols, and meanings the band and its songs have for so many. What might you mean (and what did Mick mean) by sympathy for the Devil? Did the Stones share any of the blame for the deaths at Altamont, as critic Lester Bangs charged they did in ,Rolling Stone, magazine? What theories of ethics and personality lay behind the good-boy image of the Beatles and the bad-boy reputation the Stones acquired? If Keith Richards really had his blood replaced four separate times, does that make him a zombie? How do the Glimmer Twins help us refine our understanding of friendship? Written by a dozen philosophers and scholars who adore the Rolling Stones not only for their music, this book will become required reading for anyone seeking maximum satisfaction from "the world's greatest rock and roll band."

Blurb: There have been several books published about the wartime experiences of individual air gunners but there is no general history of Air Gunners, their equipment, training or service in the various RAF Commands in which they served. This book explains in great detail how and why the trade of air gunner was developed at the outset of World War II. Chapters include the history of the guns and turrets, the famous gunners, outstanding bravery during major raids, flying with Coastal Command, Bomber Command and overseas operations. It also includes the history of Air Gunners who became prisoners of war, outstanding bravery awards and American air gunners such as Clark Gable, John Huston and Charlton Heston. It includes many first-hand accounts of wartime combat as seen from the gun turret in the heat of battle. Air Gunners, tail-end Charleys in particular, have always been popular wartime heroes as they flew in their isolated positions protecting their aircraft from enemy fighter attack in the skies over war torn Europe."

Blurb: Among the most popular of Mahler's symphonic works, the 7th Symphony has neither a "program" nor a folk-song theme. It is a purely instrumental composition, both hopeful and romantic in feeling. The restrained mood and thematic economy of the symphony make it one of the least extravagant of the composer's works; it is also one of the most enjoyable.,Despite the lack of a "program" for the 7th, some critics profess to find that "a good case can be made out for the symphony as a whole having been consciously built round the poetic idea of nocturnal nature, progressing through various shades of darkness" (,New Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,). Now musicians and music lovers can make their own determination by studying this inexpensive edition of the complete score, reprinted from the authoritative German edition of 1909.

Blurb: In this innovative history, Paige Raibmon examines the political ramifications of ideas about real Indians. Focusing on the Northwest Coast in the late nineteenth century and early twentieth, she describes how government officials, missionaries, anthropologists, reformers, settlers, and tourists developed definitions of Indian authenticity based on such binaries as Indian versus White, traditional versus modern, and uncivilized versus civilized. They recognized as authentic only those expressions of Indianness that conformed to their limited definitions and reflected their sense of colonial legitimacy and racial superiority. Raibmon shows that Whites and Aboriginals were collaboratorsalbeit unequal onesin the politics of authenticity. Non-Aboriginal people employed definitions of Indian culture that limited Aboriginal claims to resources, land, and sovereignty, while Aboriginals utilized those same definitions to access the social, political, and economic means necessary for their survival under colonialism.Drawing on research in newspapers, magazines, agency and missionary records, memoirs, and diaries, Raibmon combines cultural and labor history. She looks at three historical episodes: the participation of a group of Kwakwakawakw from Vancouver in the 1893 Worlds Columbian Exposition in Chicago; the work of migrant Aboriginal laborers in the hop fields of Puget Sound; and the legal efforts of Tlingit artist Rudolph Walton to have his mixed-race step-children admitted to the white public school in Sitka, Alaska. Together these episodes reveal the consequences of outsiders attempts to define authentic Aboriginal culture. Raibmon argues that Aboriginal culture is much more than the reproduction of rituals; it also lies in the means by which Aboriginal people generate new and meaningful ways of identifying their place in a changing modern environment.

Blurb: Georgian London was a city of extraordinary contrast: its elegance and refinement thrived amid appalling filth and foul smells, decadence and depravity. Crime was everywhere, from pickpockets and prostitutes to murderous highwaymen, as London bulged with riches from its overseas colonies. The Thieves' Opera is the story of the city, and of its two greatest criminals, Jonathan Wild and Jack Sheppard. Wild, whose excesses led to his being known as "Thief-taker General," dominated London's criminal world. And Sheppard spent his time drinking, gambling, housebreaking, and whoring. When Sheppard refused to bow to Wild's authority, Wild had him arrested. But Sheppard's extraordinary ability to escape from prison-repeatedly-made him a celebrated folk hero. Eventually the rivalry spiraled to a dramatic climax involving the entire city. An eminently readable blend of popular history and scholarship, this book is a fascinating window into a world that confounds the modern imagination.

Blurb: Every spring thousands of middle-class and lower-income high-school seniors learn that they have been rejected by Americas most exclusive colleges. What they may never learn is how many candidates like themselves have been passed over in favor of wealthy white students with lesser credentialschildren of alumni, big donors, or celebrities.,In this explosive book, the Pulitzer Prizewinning reporter Daniel Golden argues that America, the so-called land of opportunity, is rapidly becoming an aristocracy in which Americas richest families receive special access to elite higher educationenabling them to give their children even more of a head start. Based on two years of investigative reporting and hundreds of interviews with students, parents, school administrators, and admissions personnelsome of whom risked their jobs to speak to the authorThe Price of Admission exposes the corrupt admissions practices that favor the wealthy, the powerful, and the famous.,In The Price of Admission, Golden names names, along with grades and test scores. He reveals how the sons of former vice president Al Gore, one-time Hollywood power broker Michael Ovitz, and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist leapt ahead of more deserving applicants at Harvard, Brown, and Princeton. He explores favoritism at the Ivy Leagues, Duke, the University of Virginia, and Notre Dame, among other institutions. He reveals that colleges hold Asian American students to a higher standard than whites; comply with Title IX by giving scholarships to rich women in patrician sports like horseback riding, squash, and crew; and repay congressmen for favors by admitting their children. He also reveals that Harvard maintains a Z-list for well-connected but underqualified students, who are quietly admitted on the condition that they wait a year to enroll.,The Price of Admission explodes the myth of an American meritocracythe belief that no matter what your background, if you are smart and diligent enough, you will have access to the nations most elite universities. It is must reading not only for parents and students with a personal stake in college admissions, but also for those disturbed by the growing divide between ordinary and privileged Americans.

His brother Otto ("Big Red"), on the other hand, wouldn't mind climbing down from his horse and onto a train once in a whileif it'll give his saddle-sore rear end a rest. So when it's Old Red who insists they sign on to protect the luxurious Pacific Express, despite a generations-old Amlingmeyer family distrust of the farm-stealin', cattle-killin', money-grubbin' railroads, Big Red is flummoxed. But Old Red, tired of the cowpoke life, wants to take a stab at professional 'detectifying' just like his hero, Sherlock Holmes and guard jobs for the railroad are the only ones on offer. , So it is that Big Red and Old Red find themselves trapped on a thousand tons of steam-driven steel, summiting the Sierras en route to San Francisco with a crafty gang of outlaws somewhere around the next bend, a baggage car jam-packed with deadly secrets, and a vicious killer hidden somewhere amongst the colorfulpassengers. , ,On the Wrong Track,, Old Red and Big Red's much anticipated return, is filled with all of the wit, flavor, humor, and suspense that made Hockensmith's debut, ,Holmes on the Range,, so beloved by critics and fans alike.

Blurb: Every competitive chess player needs to decide which openings he wants to play. Selecting a set of moves to employ, with either white or black, against each likely countermove by your opponent is a daunting challenge that takes a lot of time and effort. Grandmaster and former senior world champion Larry Kaufman provides a ready-to-go repertoire for both colors that is based not on what on what is objectively 'best' (meaning the most popular in recent grandmaster play), but on what is easy to digest for amateurs. Kaufman has selected a range of sound lines that do not outdate rapidly, do not require the memorization of lots of theory and can be played with confidence. The recommended openings are not razor-sharp but contain enough venom for the white side to strive for a clear advantage and for sufficient counter-chances on the black side. Kaufman presents his material with a good balance between narrative and variations and also provides common-sense guidance on how to evaluate positions. This manual, a completely revised and updated edition of 'The Chess Advantage in Black and White', provides a practical and reliable chess opening repertoire for a broad audience.

Blurb: In 1978 filmmaker Hardy Jones was swept into the universe of dolphins. In his work as a filmmaker he came to know many of these magnificent animals as individuals. "I know when I'm with them that I'm relating to creatures as intelligent, social, and imbued with emotion as I am." Hardy's life became even more closely entwined with dolphins when he learned that he and the dolphins share a genetic trait that imperils both his life and the survival of dolphins worldwide. Starting with the film that came from his first life-changing encounter with spotted dolphins in the Bahamas, he's made over 70 documentaries for PBS, National Geographic, Discovery Channel, and foreign broadcasters. "Filming became my entree into the world of dolphins but not my ultimate purpose there. My true aim was to get inside the minds of these enormously intelligent and friendly animals." In coming years Hardy would apply what he had learned to killer whales in the Arctic fjords of Norway, and sperm whales off the Galapagos and the Caribbean Island of Dominica. "I became a pioneer in a parallel universe inhabited by highly intelligent, friendly, curious aliens. I came to love them and felt an intense need to protect them." For more than three decades Hardy has fought to end the slaughter of dolphins by Japanese fishermen and was instrumental in converting a dolphin hunter to a dolphin watch tour leader. In the late 1980s Hardy became aware of a threat to dolphins even more insidious that the blades of dolphin hunters - rising levels of chemical toxins in the oceans that were impacting marine life and human beings. Over succeeding decades these contaminants have reached crisis level. In 2003 Hardy was diagnosed with an incurable form of blood cancer that is linked to chemical toxins. "I've struggled with the side effects of medications, but my first lab tests after beginning treatment brought stunning results. My burden of monoclonal cells had been reduced by ninety-eight percent." The diagnosis spurred Hardy to seek the sources of the pollutants in his own body and to document their impact on marine life and human beings. Hardy continues treatment and maintains an active life traveling the world to campaign for dolphins, the oceans and the welfare of humanity."

Blurb: "House of Hunger" not only won The Guardian fiction prize but stunned the imagination of readers with its view of the slums of colonial Salisbury. "Black Sunlight" gives a similar cockroach-eye view of London.,I really tried to put terrorism into a historical perspective, neither applauding their acts nor condemning them. The photographer does not take sides; he just takes the press photographs. In an unspecified setting the stream-of-consciousness narrative of this cult novel traces the fortunes of a group of anarchists in revolt against a military-fascist-capitalist opposition. The protagonist is photojournalist Chris, whose camera lens becomes the device through which the plot is cleverly unraveled. In Dambudzo Marecheras second experimental novel, he parodies African nationalist and racial identifications as part of an argument that notions of an essential African identity were often invoked to authorize a number of totalitarian regimes across Africa. Such irreverent, avant-garde literature was criticized upon publication in Zimbabwe in 1980, and Black Sunlight was banned on charges of Euromodernism and as a challenge to the concept of nation-building in the newly independent country.

Blurb: In Imagining America, historian Alan M. Ball explores American influence in two newborn Russian states: the young Soviet Union and the modern Russian Republic. Ball deftly illustrates how in each era Russians have approached the United States with a conflicting mix of ideas--as a land to admire from afar, to shun at all costs, to emulate as quickly as possible, or to surpass on the way to a superior society. Drawing on a wide variety of sources including contemporary journals, newspapers, films, and popular songs, Ball traces the shifting Russian perceptions of American cultural, social, and political life. As he clearly demonstrates, throughout their history Russian imaginations featured a United States that political figures and intellectuals might embrace, exploit, or attack, but could not ignore.

Blurb: A scholarly work that aims to be both broad enough in scope to satisfy upper-division undergraduates studying folk belief and narrative and detailed enough to meet the needs of graduate students in the field. Each of the seven chapters in Part 1 focuses on one aspect of Russian folk belief, such as the pagan background, Christian personages, devils and various other logical categories of the topic. The author's thesis - that Russian folk belief represents a "double faith" whereby Slavic pagan beliefs are overlaid with popular Christianity - is persuasive and has analogies in other cultures. The folk narratives constituting Part 2 are translated and include a wide range of tales, from the briefly anecdotal to the more fully developed narrative, covering the various folk personages and motifs explored in Part 1.

Each chapter is filled with rich and colorful stories of the players unfortunate enough to be chosen in each category and is followed by a handy top-ten list, such as Most Overpaid Yankees., From a delightful survey of batters who fell below the dreaded "Mendoza Line" to a rundown of managers who had long careers distinguished by relentless losing to a roster of players who took steroids but ,still, stunk, ,Who's on Worst?, is a thoroughly entertaining portrait of the personalities who deserve their place in baseball history as much as the immortals.
